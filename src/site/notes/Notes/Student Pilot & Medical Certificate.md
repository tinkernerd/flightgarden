This section covers the requirements and procedures for obtaining your Student Pilot Certificate and Medical Certificate, as well as important aeromedical factors to be aware of as a new pilot.

## Student Pilot Certificate:

1. You don't need paperwork to start flight lessons, but before solo flight, you must obtain a Student Pilot Certificate.
    1. The certificate is obtained through the FAA's IACRA system.
    2. After applying, you'll need assistance from:
        1. An FAA office (FSDO).
        2. A Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE).
        3. An Airman Certification Representative (ACR) at a Part 141 pilot school.
        4. Your flight instructor.
    3. Student Pilot Certificates obtained this way do not expire.

## FAA Medical Certificate:

1. To solo and pursue most pilot certificates, you need an FAA Medical Certificate.
    1. Obtain it by passing a routine physical with an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME).
    2. A Third Class Medical Certificate is valid for:
        1. 60 calendar months if under 40 years old.
        2. 24 calendar months if 40 or older.
    3. Calendar months extend to the end of the month regardless of the exam date.
    4. Certificates can be issued with limitations for various medical conditions.
2. Sport Pilot Certificate holders flying Light Sport Aircraft solo may use a valid driver's license as proof of health.

## BasicMed:

1. Pilots requiring only a Third Class Medical may operate under BasicMed if:
    1. They have held an FAA Medical Certificate at any time after July 14, 2006.
    2. They hold a valid U.S. driver's license.
2. BasicMed privileges include:
    1. Carrying up to six passengers.
    2. Flying aircraft certified with no more than seven seats and under 12,500 pounds.
    3. Operating below 18,000 feet and under 250 knots.
3. BasicMed requirements:
    1. Visit any state-licensed physician every four years and complete the FAA Medical Examination Checklist.
    2. Complete an online medical education course every two years.
        1. Available at no charge from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA).
    3. Maintain records of the physician's exam and course completion in your logbook.

## Aeromedical Factors:

Understanding aeromedical factors is crucial for safe flying. Key factors include hypoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hyperventilation, and landing illusions.

1. Hypoxia:
    1. A lack of sufficient oxygen impairing brain and organ function.
    2. Caused by reduced atmospheric pressure at high altitudes.
    3. Symptoms include:
        1. Impaired judgment, memory, alertness, and coordination.
        2. Headaches, drowsiness, dizziness.
        3. Euphoria or belligerence.
    4. Unrecognized hypoxia can lead to unconsciousness.
    5. Preventive measures:
        1. Flights up to 10,000 feet are generally safe without supplemental oxygen.
        2. FAA requires supplemental oxygen after 30 minutes above 12,500 feet MSL.
2. Carbon Monoxide Poisoning:
    1. Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and produced by combustion.
    2. Reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen when inhaled.
    3. Aircraft heaters can be a source due to exhaust fumes.
    4. Symptoms include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches.
    5. If suspected:
        1. Close heater vents and open fresh air vents.
        2. Land as soon as practicable if symptoms are severe.
        3. Seek medical treatment if symptoms persist.
3. Hyperventilation:
    1. Occurs when breathing rate or depth is abnormally increased due to stress or anxiety.
    2. Reduces carbon dioxide needed to regulate breathing.
    3. Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, tingling, drowsiness, unconsciousness.
    4. Remedies:
        1. Control your breathing rate and depth.
        2. Talk loudly or sing to reduce breathing rate.
        3. Breathe into a paper bag to increase carbon dioxide levels.
4. Landing Illusions:
    1. Various illusions can affect landing approaches due to surface features or atmospheric conditions.
    2. Narrower-than-usual runway:
        1. Creates illusion of being higher.
        2. May cause a lower approach and risk of landing short.
    3. Wider-than-usual runway:
        1. Creates illusion of being lower.
        2. May cause a higher approach or overshooting the runway.
    4. Up-sloping runway:
        1. Makes you feel higher, leading to a lower approach.
    5. Down-sloping runway:
        1. Makes you feel lower, leading to a higher approach.
    6. Other factors causing illusions:
        1. Water or featureless terrain.
        2. Rain on the windshield.
        3. Atmospheric haze.

By being aware of these factors and taking proper precautions, you can ensure a safe and enjoyable flying experience.

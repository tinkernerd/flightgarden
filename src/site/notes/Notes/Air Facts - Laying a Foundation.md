# Air Facts - Laying a Foundation
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section focuses on the importance of weather knowledge and preparation for both VFR and IFR flying, emphasizing the continuation of training towards an instrument rating.

## Studying Weather for Pilot Training:

1. Understand VFR conditions and recognize conditions leading to below VFR weather.
2. Realize the importance of obtaining an instrument rating:
    1. An instrument rating is a crucial next step in pilot training.
    2. Allows safe flying in conditions unsuitable for VFR, especially outside the desert southwest.
3. Consider weather in relation to:
    1. Flying VFR as a private pilot.
    2. Flying IFR after obtaining the instrument rating.

## Post-Private Certificate Flying:

1. Recognize the critical phase without instructor oversight:
    1. No instructor to check cross-country flight preparation.
    2. Instructors often avoid marginal VFR conditions during training.
2. Be cautious with marginal VFR:
    1. Marginal VFR defined as a 3,000 ft ceiling and 5 miles visibility.
    2. Pilots have no formal training in marginal VFR flying during initial training.
    3. Legal minimums are not always safe.
3. Develop procedures and precautions:
    1. Maintain a safe margin above minimum VFR weather requirements.
    2. Consider factors like obstructions, terrain, and darkness.

## Laying the Foundation for IFR Flying:

1. Advance weather knowledge to make good IFR judgments.
2. Interpret weather data for both IFR and VFR flights.
3. Understand the challenges of IFR flying:
    1. Flying in or above clouds instead of beneath them.
    2. Cannot visually avoid thunderstorms; must plan ahead.
    3. Use tools like ADS-B datalink weather for real-time updates.
4. Be aware of airframe icing:
    4. In VFR, icing is rare and usually due to freezing rain.
    5. In IFR, icing can occur in clouds between -15°C and 0°C.

Remember, as a pilot, it's your responsibility to interpret raw weather data and make conservative decisions. Weather is not only a critical safety factor but also one of the most interesting aspects of flying.

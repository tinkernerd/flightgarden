\(c\) *Auxiliary Fuel Tanks.* After the applicable date stated in paragraph (e) of this section, no foreign air carrier or foreign person may operate any airplane subject [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0026 Continued airworthiness and safety improvements for transport category airplanes#§26.33   Holders of type certificates: Fuel tank flammability.\|§26.33]] of this chapter that has an Auxiliary Fuel Tank installed pursuant to a field approval, unless the following requirements are met:

\(1\) The foreign air carrier or foreign person complies with 14 CFR 26.35 by the applicable date stated in that section.

\(2\) The foreign air carrier or foreign person installs Flammability Impact Mitigation Means (FIMM), if applicable, that are approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office.

\(3\) Except in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0129 Operations  foreign air carriers and foreign operators of u.s.-registered aircraft engaged in common carriage#§129.14   Maintenance program and minimum equipment list requirements for U.S.-registered aircraft.\|§129.14]], the FIMM, if applicable, are operational.

\(d\) *Retrofit.* After the dates specified in paragraph (e) of this section, no foreign air carrier or foreign person may operate an airplane to which this section applies unless the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section are met.

\(1\) IMM, FRM or FIMM, if required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0026 Continued airworthiness and safety improvements for transport category airplanes#§26.33   Holders of type certificates: Fuel tank flammability.\|§§26.33]], 26.35, or 26.37 of this chapter, that are approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office, are installed within the compliance times specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

\(2\) Except in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0129 Operations  foreign air carriers and foreign operators of u.s.-registered aircraft engaged in common carriage#§129.14   Maintenance program and minimum equipment list requirements for U.S.-registered aircraft.\|§129.14]], the IMM, FRM or FIMM, as applicable, are operational.

\(e\) *Compliance Times.* Except as provided in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, the installations required by paragraph (d) of this section must be accomplished no later than the applicable dates specified in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.

\(f\) *Compliance after Installation.* Except in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0129 Operations  foreign air carriers and foreign operators of u.s.-registered aircraft engaged in common carriage#§129.14   Maintenance program and minimum equipment list requirements for U.S.-registered aircraft.\|§129.14]], no person may—

\(1\) Operate an airplane on which IMM or FRM has been installed before the dates specified in paragraph (e) of this section unless the IMM or FRM is operational.

\(2\) Deactivate or remove an IMM or FRM once installed unless it is replaced by a means that complies with paragraph (d) of this section.

\(g\) *Maintenance Program Revisions.* No foreign air carrier or foreign person may operate an airplane for which airworthiness limitations have been approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0026 Continued airworthiness and safety improvements for transport category airplanes#§26.33   Holders of type certificates: Fuel tank flammability.\|§§26.33]], 26.35, or 26.37 of this chapter after the airplane is modified in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section unless the maintenance program for that airplane is revised to include those applicable airworthiness limitations.

\(h\) After the maintenance program is revised as required by paragraph (g) of this section, before returning an airplane to service after any alteration for which airworthiness limitations are required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.981   Fuel tank explosion prevention.\|§§25.981]], 26.33, 26.35, or 26.37 of this chapter, the foreign person or foreign air carrier must revise the maintenance program for the airplane to include those airworthiness limitations.

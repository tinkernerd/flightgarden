### §137.47   Operation without position lights.

Notwithstanding [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules\|part 91 of this chapter]], an aircraft may be operated without position lights if prominent unlighted objects are visible for at least 1 mile and takeoffs and landings at—

\(a\) Airports with a functioning control tower are made only as authorized by the control tower operator; and

\(b\) Other airports are made only with the permission of the airport management and no other aircraft operations requiring position lights are in progress at that airport.

### §137.49   Operations over other than congested areas.

Notwithstanding [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules\|part 91 of this chapter]], during the actual dispensing operation, including approaches, departures, and turnarounds reasonably necessary for the operation, an aircraft may be operated over other than congested areas below 500 feet above the surface and closer than 500 feet to persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures, if the operations are conducted without creating a hazard to persons or property on the surface.

\[Amdt. 137-3, 33 FR 9601, July 2, 1968\]

### §137.51   Operation over congested areas: General.

\(a\) Notwithstanding [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules\|part 91 of this chapter]], an aircraft may be operated over a congested area at altitudes required for the proper accomplishment of the agricultural aircraft operation if the operation is conducted—

\(1\) With the maximum safety to persons and property on the surface, consistent with the operation; and

\(2\) In accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

\(b\) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area except in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.

\(1\) Prior written approval must be obtained from the appropriate official or governing body of the political subdivision over which the operations are conducted.

\(2\) Notice of the intended operation must be given to the public by some effective means, such as daily newspapers, radio, television, or door-to-door notice.

\(3\) A plan for each complete operation must be submitted to, and approved by appropriate personnel of the responsible Flight Standards office for the area where the operation is to be conducted. The plan must include consideration of obstructions to flight; the emergency landing capabilities of the aircraft to be used; and any necessary coordination with air traffic control.

\(4\) Single engine aircraft must be operated as follows:

\(i\) Except for helicopters, no person may take off a loaded aircraft, or make a turnaround over a congested area.

\(ii\) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules\|part 91 of this chapter]] except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures necessary for that operation.

\(iii\) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures for that operation, unless it is operated in a pattern and at such an altitude that the aircraft can land, in an emergency, without endangering persons or property on the surface.

\(5\) Multiengine aircraft must be operated as follows:

\(i\) No person may take off a multiengine airplane over a congested area except under conditions that will allow the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of the runway from any point on takeoff up to the time of attaining, with all engines operating at normal takeoff power, 105 percent of the minimum control speed with the critical engine inoperative in the takeoff configuration or 115 percent of the power-off stall speed in the takeoff configuration, whichever is greater, as shown by the accelerate stop distance data. In applying this requirement, takeoff data is based upon still-air conditions, and no correction is made for any uphill gradient of 1 percent or less when the percentage is measured as the difference between elevation at the end points of the runway divided by the total length. For uphill gradients greater than 1 percent, the effective takeoff length of the runway is reduced 20 percent for each 1-percent grade.

\(ii\) No person may operate a multiengine airplane at a weight greater than the weight that, with the critical engine inoperative, would permit a rate of climb of at least 50 feet per minute at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the elevation of the highest ground or obstruction within the area to be worked or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher. For the purposes of this subdivision, it is assumed that the propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position; that the wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable positions; and that the remaining engine or engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available.

\(iii\) No person may operate any multiengine aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules\|part 91 of this chapter]] except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches, departures, and turnarounds necessary for that operation.

\(2\) 100 hours of flight experience as pilot in command in dispensing agricultural materials or chemicals.

\(c\) *Aircraft.* (1) Each aircraft must—(i) If it is an aircraft not specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, have had within the preceding 100 hours of time in service a 100-hour or annual inspection by a person authorized by part 65 or 145 of this chapter, or have been inspected under a progressive inspection system; and

\(ii\) If it is a large or turbine-powered multiengine civil airplane of U.S. registry, have been inspected in accordance with the applicable inspection program requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.409   Inspections.\|§91.409]] of this chapter.

\(2\) If other than a helicopter, it must be equipped with a device capable of jettisoning at least one-half of the aircraft's maximum authorized load of agricultural material within 45 seconds.

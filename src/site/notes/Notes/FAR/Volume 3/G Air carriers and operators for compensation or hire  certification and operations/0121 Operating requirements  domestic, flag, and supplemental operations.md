## Subpart I—Airplane Performance Operating Limitations

<div>

Editorial Note: Nomenclature changes to subpart I of part 121 appear at 60 FR 65928, Dec. 20, 1995.

</div>

### §121.171   Applicability.

\(a\) This subpart prescribes airplane performance operating limitations for all certificate holders.

\(b\) For purposes of this part, *effective length of the runway* for landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end thereof.

\(c\) For the purposes of this subpart, *obstruction clearance plane* means a plane sloping upward from the runway at a slope of 1:20 to the horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all obstructions within a specified area surrounding the runway as shown in a profile view of that area. In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects the centerline of the runway and proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point. Thereafter the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns of at least 4,000 foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway; thereafter it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.

### §121.177   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Takeoff limitations.

\(a\) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may takeoff that airplane unless it is possible—

\(1\) To stop the airplane safely on the runway, as shown by the accelerate stop distance data, at any time during takeoff until reaching critical-engine failure speed;

\(2\) If the critical engine fails at any time after the airplane reaches critical-engine failure speed *V*1, to continue the takeoff and reach a height of 50 feet, as indicated by the takeoff path data, before passing over the end of the runway; and

\(3\) To clear all obstacles either by at least 50 feet vertically (as shown by the takeoff path data) or 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and 300 feet horizontally beyond the boundaries, without banking before reaching a height of 50 feet (as shown by the takeoff path data) and thereafter without banking more than 15 degrees.

\(b\) In applying this section, corrections must be made for the effective runway gradient. To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based on still air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50 percent of any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent of any reported tailwind component.

\(c\) This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.173   General.\|§121.173]](c).

(0.079-0.106/N) Vso2

\(b\) In place of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a person may, under an approved procedure, operate a reciprocating engine powered airplane, at an all-engines-operating altitude that allows the airplane to continue, after an engine failure, to an alternate airport where a landing can be made in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.187   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airport.\|§121.187]], allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil. After the assumed failure, the flight path must clear the ground and any obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet.

\(c\) If an approved procedure under paragraph (b) of this section is used, the certificate holder shall comply with the following:

\(1\) The rate of climb (as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the appropriate weight and altitude) used in calculating the airplane's flight path shall be diminished by an amount, in feet per minute, equal to

(0.079-0.106/N) Vso2

\(2\) The all-engines-operating altitude shall be sufficient so that in the event the critical engine becomes inoperative at any point along the route, the flight will be able to proceed to a predetermined alternate airport by use of this procedure. In determining the takeoff weight, the airplane is assumed to pass over the critical obstruction following engine failure at a point no closer to the critical obstruction than the nearest approved radio navigational fix, unless the Administrator approves a procedure established on a different basis upon finding that adequate operational safeguards exist.

\(3\) The airplane must meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section at 1,000 feet above the airport used as an alternate in this procedure.

\(4\) The procedure must include an approved method of accounting for winds and temperatures that would otherwise adversely affect the flight path.

\(5\) In complying with this procedure fuel jettisoning is allowed if the certificate holder shows that it has an adequate training program, that proper instructions are given to the flight crew, and all other precautions are taken to insure a safe procedure.

\(6\) The certificate holder shall specify in the dispatch or flight release an alternate airport that meets the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.625   Alternate Airport weather minima.\|§121.625]].

\(d\) This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.173   General.\|§121.173]](c).

### §121.183   Part 25 airplanes with four or more engines: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: Two engines inoperative.

\(a\) No person may operate an airplane certificated under part 25 and having four or more engines unless—

\(1\) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport that meets the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.187   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airport.\|§121.187]]; or

\(2\) It is operated at a weight allowing the airplane, with the two critical engines inoperative, to climb at 0.013 Vso2 feet per minute (that is, the number of feet per minute is obtained by multiplying the number of knots squared by 0.013) at an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

\(b\) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that—

### §121.185   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing limitations: Destination airport.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section no person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may take off that airplane, unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet directly above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purposes of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:

\(1\) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction in still air.

\(2\) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

\(b\) An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is specified that meets all of the requirements of this section except that the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

\(c\) This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.173   General.\|§121.173]](c).

### §121.187   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airport.

\(a\) No person may list an airport as an alternate airport in a dispatch or flight release unless the airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival at the airport), based on the assumptions in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.185   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing limitations: Destination airport.\|§121.185]], can be brought to a full stop landing, within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

\(b\) This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.173   General.\|§121.173]](c).

\(b\) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August 30, 1959 (SR422, 422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minimum distances required for takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a clearway distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater than 1⁄2 of the takeoff run.

\(c\) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual at which compliance with the following may be shown:

\(1\) The accelerate-stop distance must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any stopway.

\(2\) The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.

\(3\) The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the runway.

\(d\) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual—

\(1\) In the case of an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that clears all obstacles either by at least (35 + 0.01D) feet vertically (D is the distance along the intended flight path from the end of the runway in feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries; or

\(2\) In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR 422A, 422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all obstacles either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries.

\(e\) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.

\(f\) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the Airplane Flight Manual, and thereafter that the maximum bank is not more than 15 degrees.

\(g\) For the purposes of this section the terms, *takeoff distance, takeoff run, net takeoff flight path* and *takeoff path* have the same meanings as set forth in the rules under which the airplane was certificated.

\(a\) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that is greater than that which (under the approved, one engine inoperative, en route net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane) will allow compliance with paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, based on the ambient temperatures expected en route:

\(1\) There is a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the intended track, and, in addition, if that airplane was certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR 422B) there is a positive slope at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane is assumed to land after an engine fails.

\(5\) The alternate airport is specified in the dispatch or flight release and meets the prescribed weather minimums; and

\(6\) The consumption of fuel and oil after engine failure is the same as the consumption that is allowed for in the approved net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 feet a minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

\(b\) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the Administrator finds that safe operations are not impaired, a person may operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of engine failure, to clear all obstructions within 5 miles on each side of the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate of descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 feet a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. Before approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the following for the route, route segment, or area concerned:

\(1\) The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.

\(2\) The location and kinds of navigation aids.

\(3\) The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency and amount of turbulence normally encountered.

\(1\) Allowing for anticipated consumption of fuel and oil, is greater than the weight that would allow a full stop landing within 60 percent of the effective length of the most suitable runway at the destination airport; and

\(2\) Is greater than the weight allowable if the landing is to be made on the runway—

\(i\) With the greatest effective length in still air; and

\(ii\) Required by the probable wind, taking into account not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

\(b\) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that—

\(1\) The airplane passes directly over the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway at a height of 50 feet in a steady gliding approach at a true indicated airspeed of at least 1.3 *VS*o;

\(2\) The landing does not require exceptional pilot skill; and

\(d\) If the Administrator determines that, for a particular model of airplane used in cargo service, literal compliance with any requirement under paragraph (b) of this section would be extremely difficult and that compliance would not contribute materially to the objective sought, he may require compliance only with those requirements that are necessary to accomplish the basic objectives of this part.

\(e\) No person may operate under this part a nontransport category airplane type certificated after December 31, 1964, unless the airplane meets the special airworthiness requirements in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.293   Special airworthiness requirements for nontransport category airplanes type certificated after December 31, 1964.\|§121.293]].

</div>

### §121.310   Additional emergency equipment.

\(a\) *Means for emergency evacuation.* Each passenger-carrying landplane emergency exit (other than over-the-wing) that is more than 6 feet from the ground with the airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, must have an approved means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground. The assisting means for a floor-level emergency exit must meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.809   Emergency exit arrangement.\|§25.809]](f)(1) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972, except that, for any airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed after that date, it must meet the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. An assisting means that deploys automatically must be armed during taxiing, takeoffs, and landings. However, if the Administrator finds that the design of the exit makes compliance impractical, he may grant a deviation from the requirement of automatic deployment if the assisting means automatically erects upon deployment and, with respect to required emergency exits, if an emergency evacuation demonstration is conducted in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.291   Demonstration of emergency evacuation procedures.\|§121.291]](a). This paragraph does not apply to the rear window emergency exit of DC-3 airplanes operated with less than 36 occupants, including crewmembers and less than five exits authorized for passenger use.

\(b\) *Interior emergency exit marking.* The following must be complied with for each passenger-carrying airplane:

\(1\) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of opening must be conspicuously marked. The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin. The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle. There must be a locating sign—

\(i\) Above the aisle near each over-the-wing passenger emergency exit, or at another ceiling location if it is more practical because of low headroom;

\(ii\) Next to each floor level passenger emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from that sign; and

\(iii\) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by it, except that if this is not possible the sign may be placed at another appropriate location.

\(2\) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must meet the following:

\(i\) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, for an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]](b) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed if it increases the emergency illumination of the passenger compartment. However, the Administrator may authorize deviation from the 2-inch background requirements if he finds that special circumstances exist that make compliance impractical and that the proposed deviation provides an equivalent level of safety.

\(ii\) For a transport category airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the interior emergency exit marking requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 250 microlamberts.

\(iii\) For a nontransport category turbopropeller powered airplane type certificated after December 31, 1964, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to have white letters 1 inch high on a red background 2 inches high, be self-illuminated or independently, internally electrically illuminated, and have a minimum brightness of at least 160 microlamberts. The color may be reversed if the passenger compartment illumination is essentially the same. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.

\(c\) *Lighting for interior emergency exit markings.* Except for nontransport category airplanes type certificated after December 31, 1964, each passenger-carrying airplane must have an emergency lighting system, independent of the main lighting system. However, sources of general cabin illumination may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting systems if the power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the power supply to the main lighting system.

The emergency lighting system must—

\(1\) Illuminate each passenger exit marking and locating sign;

\(2\) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that the average illumination when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat armrest height, on the centerline of the main passenger aisle, is at least 0.05 foot-candles; and

\(3\) For airplanes type certificated after January 1, 1958, after November 26, 1986, include floor proximity emergency escape path marking which meets the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]](e) of this chapter in effect on November 26, 1984.

\(d\) *Emergency light operation.* Except for lights forming part of emergency lighting subsystems provided in compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]](h) of this chapter (as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section) that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of the airplane's main emergency lighting systems, and are automatically activated when the assist means is deployed, each light required by paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section must comply with the following:

\(1\) Each light must—

\(i\) Be operable manually both from the flightcrew station and, for airplanes on which a flight attendant is required, from a point in the passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a normal flight attendant seat;

\(ii\) Have a means to prevent inadvertent operation of the manual controls; and

\(iii\) When armed or turned on at either station, remain lighted or become lighted upon interruption of the airplane's normal electric power.

\(2\) Each light must be armed or turned on during taxiing, takeoff, and landing. In showing compliance with this paragraph a transverse vertical separation of the fuselage need not be considered.

\(3\) Each light must provide the required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the critical ambient conditions after emergency landing.

\(4\) Each light must have a cockpit control device that has an “on,” “off,” and “armed” position.

\(e\) *Emergency exit operating handles.* (1) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle, and instructions for opening the exit, must be shown by a marking on or near the exit that is readable from a distance of 30 inches. In addition, for each Type I and Type II emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, the instructions for opening must be shown by—

\(i\) A red arrow with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70° of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length; and

\(ii\) The word “open” in red letters 1 inch high placed horizontally near the head of the arrow.

\(2\) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for opening the exit must be shown in accordance with the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no operating handle or operating handle cover may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.

\(f\) *Emergency exit access.* Access to emergency exits must be provided as follows for each passenger-carrying transport category airplane:

\(1\) Each passage way between individual passenger areas, or leading to a Type I or Type II emergency exit, must be unobstructed and at least 20 inches wide.

\(2\) For each Type I or Type II emergency exit equipped with an assist means, there must be enough space next to the exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. In addition, all airplanes manufactured on or after November 26, 2008 must comply with the provisions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.813   Emergency exit access.\|§§25.813]](b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) in effect on November 26, 2004. However, a deviation from this requirement may be authorized for an airplane certificated under the provisions of part 4b of the Civil Air Regulations in effect before December 20, 1951, if the Administrator finds that special circumstances exist that provide an equivalent level of safety.

\(3\) There must be access from the main aisle to each Type III and Type IV exit. The access from the aisle to these exits must not be obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions in a manner that would reduce the effectiveness of the exit. In addition—

\(i\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the access must meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.813   Emergency exit access.\|§25.813]](c) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972; and

\(ii\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the access must meet the emergency exit access requirements under which the airplane was type certificated; except that,

\(iii\) After December 3, 1992, the access for an airplane type certificated after January 1, 1958, must meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.813   Emergency exit access.\|§25.813]](c) of this chapter, effective June 3, 1992.

\(iv\) Contrary provisions of this section notwithstanding, the Director of the division of the Aircraft Certification Service responsible for the airworthiness rules may authorize deviation from the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section if it is determined that special circumstances make compliance impractical. Such special circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following conditions when they preclude achieving compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.813   Emergency exit access.\|§25.813]](c)(1)(i) or (ii) without a reduction in the total number of passenger seats: emergency exits located in close proximity to each other; fixed installations such as lavatories, galleys, etc.; permanently mounted bulkheads; an insufficient number of rows ahead of or behind the exit to enable compliance without a reduction in the seat row pitch of more than one inch; or an insufficient number of such rows to enable compliance without a reduction in the seat row pitch to less than 30 inches. A request for such grant of deviation must include credible reasons as to why literal compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.813   Emergency exit access.\|§25.813]](c)(1)(i) or (ii) is impractical and a description of the steps taken to achieve a level of safety as close to that intended by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.813   Emergency exit access.\|§25.813]](c)(1)(i) or (ii) as is practical.

\(v\) The Director of the division of the Aircraft Certification Service responsible for the airworthiness rules may also authorize a compliance date later than December 3, 1992, if it is determined that special circumstances make compliance by that date impractical. A request for such grant of deviation must outline the airplanes for which compliance will be achieved by December 3, 1992, and include a proposed schedule for incremental compliance of the remaining airplanes in the operator's fleet. In addition, the request must include credible reasons why compliance cannot be achieved earlier.

\(a\) *General.* When operating a turbine engine powered airplane, each certificate holder shall equip the airplane with sustaining oxygen and dispensing equipment for use as set forth in this section:

\(1\) The amount of oxygen provided must be at least the quantity necessary to comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

\(2\) The amount of sustaining and first-aid oxygen required for a particular operation to comply with the rules in this part is determined on the basis of cabin pressure altitudes and flight duration, consistent with the operating procedures established for each operation and route.

\(3\) The requirements for airplanes with pressurized cabins are determined on the basis of cabin pressure altitude and the assumption that a cabin pressurization failure will occur at the altitude or point of flight that is most critical from the standpoint of oxygen need, and that after the failure the airplane will descend in accordance with the emergency procedures specified in the Airplane Flight Manual, without exceeding its operating limitations, to a flight altitude that will allow successful termination of the flight.

\(4\) Following the failure, the cabin pressure altitude is considered to be the same as the flight altitude unless it is shown that no probable failure of the cabin or pressurization equipment will result in a cabin pressure altitude equal to the flight altitude. Under those circumstances, the maximum cabin pressure altitude attained may be used as a basis for certification or determination of oxygen supply, or both.

\(b\) *Crewmembers.* Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of oxygen for crewmembers in accordance with the following:

\(1\) At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet, up to and including 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for and used by each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty and must be provided for other crewmembers for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration.

\(2\) At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers during the entire flight at those altitudes.

\(3\) When a flight crewmember is required to use oxygen, he must use it continuously except when necessary to remove the oxygen mask or other dispenser in connection with his regular duties. Standby crewmembers who are on call or are definitely going to have flight deck duty before completing the flight must be provided with an amount of supplemental oxygen equal to that provided for crewmembers on duty other than on flight duty. If a standby crewmember is not on call and will not be on flight deck duty during the remainder of the flight, he is considered to be a passenger for the purposes of supplemental oxygen requirements.

\(c\) *Passengers.* Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of oxygen for passengers in accordance with the following:

\(1\) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet, up to and including 14,000 feet, enough oxygen for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration, for 10 percent of the passengers.

\(2\) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet, up to and including 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for that part of the flight at those altitudes for 30 percent of the passengers.

\(3\) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for each passenger carried during the entire flight at those altitudes.

### §121.331   Supplemental oxygen requirements for pressurized cabin airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered airplanes.

\(a\) When operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane pressurized cabin, each certificate holder shall equip the airplane to comply with paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section in the event of cabin pressurization failure.

\(b\) *For crewmembers.* When operating at flight altitudes above 10,000 feet, the certificate holder shall provide enough oxygen for each crewmember for the entire flight at those altitudes and not less than a two-hour supply for each flight crewmember on flight deck duty. The required two hours supply is that quantity of oxygen necessary for a constant rate of descent from the airplane's maximum certificated operating altitude to 10,000 feet in ten minutes and followed by 110 minutes at 10,000 feet. The oxygen required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.337   Protective breathing equipment.\|§121.337]] may be considered in determining the supplemental breathing supply required for flight crewmembers on flight deck duty in the event of cabin pressurization failure.

\(c\) *For passengers.* When operating at flight altitudes above 8,000 feet, the certificate holder shall provide oxygen as follows:

\(1\) When an airplane is not flown at a flight altitude above flight level 250, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers, if at any point along the route to be flown the airplane can safely descend to a flight altitude of 14,000 feet or less within four minutes.

\(2\) If the airplane cannot descend to a flight altitude of 14,000 feet or less within four minutes, the following supply of oxygen must be provided:

\(i\) For that part of the flight that is more than four minutes duration at flight altitudes above 15,000 feet, the supply required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.327   Supplemental oxygen: Reciprocating engine powered airplanes.\|§121.327]](c)(3).

### §121.401   Training program: General.

\(a\) Each certificate holder shall:

\(1\) Establish and implement a training program that satisfies the requirements of this subpart and appendices E and F of this part and that ensures that each crewmember, aircraft dispatcher, flight instructor and check airman is adequately trained to perform his or her assigned duties. Prior to implementation, the certificate holder must obtain initial and final FAA approval of the training program.

\(2\) Provide adequate ground and flight training facilities and properly qualified ground instructors for the training required by this subpart;

\(3\) Provide and keep current with respect to each airplane type and, if applicable, the particular variations within that airplane type, appropriate training material, examinations, forms, instructions, and procedures for use in conducting the training and checks required by this part; and

\(4\) Provide enough flight instructors and approved check airmen to conduct the flight training and checks required under this part.

\(b\) Whenever a crewmember or aircraft dispatcher who is required to take recurrent training, a flight check, or a competence check, takes the check or completes the training in the calendar month before or after the calendar month in which that training or check is required, he is considered to have taken or completed it in the calendar month in which it was required.

\(c\) Each instructor, supervisor, or check airman who is responsible for a particular ground training subject, segment of flight training, course of training, flight check, or competence check under this part shall certify as to the proficiency and knowledge of the crewmember, aircraft dispatcher, flight instructor, or check airman concerned upon completion of that training or check. That certification shall be made a part of the crewmember's or dispatcher's record. When the certification required by this paragraph is made by an entry in a computerized recordkeeping system, the certifying instructor, supervisor, or check airman must be identified with that entry. However, the signature of the certifying instructor, supervisor, or check airman is not required for computerized entries.

\(d\) Training subjects that are applicable to more than one airplane or crewmember position and that have been satisfactorily completed in connection with prior training for another airplane or another crewmember position, need not be repeated during subsequent training other than recurrent training.

\(e\) A person who progresses successfully through flight training, is recommended by his instructor or a check airman, and successfully completes the appropriate flight check for a check airman or the Administrator, need not complete the programmed hours of flight training for the particular airplane. However, whenever the Administrator finds that 20 percent of the flight checks given at a particular training base during the previous 6 months under this paragraph are unsuccessful, this paragraph may not be used by the certificate holder at that base until the Administrator finds that the effectiveness of the flight training there has improved.

### §121.463   Aircraft dispatcher qualifications.

\(a\) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher for a particular airplane group unless that person has, with respect to an airplane of that group, satisfactorily completed the following:

\(1\) Initial dispatcher training, except that a person who has satisfactorily completed such training for another type airplane of the same group need only complete the appropriate transition training.

\(2\) Operating familiarization consisting of at least 5 hours observing operations under this part from the flight deck or, for airplanes without an observer seat on the flight deck, from a forward passenger seat with headset or speaker. This requirement may be reduced to a minimum of 21⁄2 hours by the substitution of one additional takeoff and landing for an hour of flight. A person may serve as an aircraft dispatcher without meeting the requirement of this paragraph (a) for 90 days after initial introduction of the airplane into operations under this part.

\(b\) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher for a particular type airplane unless that person has, with respect to that airplane, satisfactorily completed differences training, if applicable.

\(c\) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher unless within the preceding 12 calendar months the aircraft dispatcher has satisfactorily completed operating familiarization consisting of at least 5 hours observing operations under this part, in one of the types of airplanes in each group to be dispatched. This observation shall be made from the flight deck or, for airplanes without an observer seat on the flight deck, from a forward passenger seat with headset or speaker. The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced to a minimum of 21⁄2 hours by the substitution of one additional takeoff and landing for an hour of flight. The requirement of this paragraph may be satisfied by observation of 5 hours of simulator training for each airplane group in one of the simulators approved under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.407   Training program: Approval of flight simulation training devices.\|§121.407]] for the group. However, if the requirement of paragraph (a) is met by the use of a simulator, no reduction in hours is permitted.

\(d\) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve as an aircraft dispatcher to dispatch airplanes in operations under this part unless the certificate holder has determined that he is familiar with all essential operating procedures for that segment of the operation over which he exercises dispatch jurisdiction. However, a dispatcher who is qualified to dispatch airplanes through one segment of an operation may dispatch airplanes through other segments of the operation after coordinating with dispatchers who are qualified to dispatch airplanes through those other segments.

\(e\) For the purposes of this section, the airplane groups, terms, and definitions in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.400   Applicability and terms used.\|§121.400]] apply.

### §121.465   Aircraft dispatcher duty time limitations: Domestic and flag operations.

\(a\) Each certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations shall establish the daily duty period for a dispatcher so that it begins at a time that allows him or her to become thoroughly familiar with existing and anticipated weather conditions along the route before he or she dispatches any airplane. He or she shall remain on duty until each airplane dispatched by him or her has completed its flight, or has gone beyond his or her jurisdiction, or until he or she is relieved by another qualified dispatcher.

\(b\) Except in cases where circumstances or emergency conditions beyond the control of the certificate holder require otherwise—

\(1\) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may schedule a dispatcher for more than 10 consecutive hours of duty;

\(2\) If a dispatcher is scheduled for more than 10 hours of duty in 24 consecutive hours, the certificate holder shall provide him or her a rest period of at least eight hours at or before the end of 10 hours of duty.

\(3\) Each dispatcher must be relieved of all duty with the certificate holder for at least 24 consecutive hours during any seven consecutive days or the equivalent thereof within any calendar month.

\(c\) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a certificate holder conducting flag operations may, if authorized by the Administrator, schedule an aircraft dispatcher at a duty station outside of the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, for more than 10 consecutive hours of duty in a 24-hour period if that aircraft dispatcher is relieved of all duty with the certificate holder for at least eight hours during each 24-hour period.

\(9\) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, if a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations elects to reduce the rest period to 10 hours as authorized by paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the certificate holder may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 hours during the 24-hour period commencing after the beginning of the reduced rest period.

\(10\) No certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant any duty period with the certificate holder unless the flight attendant has had at least the minimum rest required under this section.

\(11\) No certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to perform any duty with the certificate holder during any required rest period.

\(12\) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's home station, is not considered part of a rest period.

\(13\) Each certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air transportation and each commercial operator must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air commerce from all further duty for at least 24 consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days.

\(14\) A flight attendant is not considered to be scheduled for duty in excess of duty period limitations if the flights to which the flight attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally terminate within the limitations but due to circumstances beyond the control of the certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations (such as adverse weather conditions) are not at the time of departure expected to reach their destination within the scheduled time.

\(c\) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may apply the flightcrew member flight time and duty limitations and rest requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0117 Flight and duty limitations and rest requirements  flightcrew members\|part 117 of this chapter]] to flight attendants for all operations conducted under this part provided that—

\(1\) The certificate holder establishes written procedures that—

\(i\) Apply to all flight attendants used in the certificate holder's operation;

\(ii\) Include the flightcrew member requirements contained in part 117, as appropriate to the operation being conducted, except that rest facilities on board the aircraft are not required;

\(iv\) Are approved by the Administrator and are described or referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications; and

\(2\) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary for the continued adequacy of the written procedures that are required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that had been granted final approval, the certificate holder must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the procedures that are found necessary by the Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate holder receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider the notice with the responsible Flight Standards office. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice, pending decision by the Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that an emergency requires immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without stay.

### §121.579   Minimum altitudes for use of autopilot.

\(a\) *Definitions.* For purpose of this section—

\(1\) Altitudes for takeoff/initial climb and go-around/missed approach are defined as above the airport elevation.

\(2\) Altitudes for enroute operations are defined as above terrain elevation.

\(3\) Altitudes for approach are defined as above the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE), unless the altitude is specifically in reference to DA (H) or MDA, in which case the altitude is defined by reference to the DA(H) or MDA itself.

\(b\) *Takeoff and initial climb.* No person may use an autopilot for takeoff or initial climb below the higher of 500 feet or an altitude that is no lower than twice the altitude loss specified in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), except as follows—

\(1\) At a minimum engagement altitude specified in the AFM; or

\(2\) At an altitude specified by the Administrator, whichever is greater.

\(c\) *Enroute.* No person may use an autopilot enroute, including climb and descent, below the following—

\(1\) 500 feet;

\(2\) At an altitude that is no lower than twice the altitude loss specified in the AFM for an autopilot malfunction in cruise conditions; or

\(3\) At an altitude specified by the Administrator, whichever is greater.

\(d\) *Approach.* No person may use an autopilot at an altitude lower than 50 feet below the DA(H) or MDA for the instrument procedure being flown, except as follows—

\(1\) For autopilots with an AFM specified altitude loss for approach operations—

\(i\) An altitude no lower than twice the specified altitude loss if higher than 50 feet below the MDA or DA(H);

\(ii\) An altitude no lower than 50 feet higher than the altitude loss specified in the AFM, when the following conditions are met—

\(3\) The certificate holder's holdover timetables and the procedures for the use of these tables by the certificate holder's personnel. Holdover time is the estimated time deicing/anti-icing fluid will prevent the formation of frost or ice and the accumulation of snow on the protected surfaces of an aircraft. Holdover time begins when the final application of deicing/anti-icing fluid commences and expires when the deicing/anti-icing fluid applied to the aircraft loses its effectiveness. The holdover times must be supported by data acceptable to the Administrator. The certificate holder's program must include procedures for flight crewmembers to increase or decrease the determined holdover time in changing conditions. The program must provide that takeoff after exceeding any maximum holdover time in the certificate holder's holdover timetable is permitted only when at least one of the following conditions exists:

\(i\) A pretakeoff contamination check, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, determines that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of frost, ice, or snow.

\(ii\) It is otherwise determined by an alternate procedure approved by the Administrator in accordance with the certificate holder's approved program that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of frost, ice, or snow.

\(iii\) The wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces are redeiced and a new holdover time is determined.

\(4\) Aircraft deicing/anti-icing procedures and responsibilities, pretakeoff check procedures and responsibilities, and pretakeoff contamination check procedures and responsibilities. A pretakeoff check is a check of the aircraft's wings or representative aircraft surfaces for frost, ice, or snow within the aircraft's holdover time. A pretakeoff contamination check is a check to make sure the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of frost, ice, and snow. It must be conducted within five minutes prior to beginning take off. This check must be accomplished from outside the aircraft unless the program specifies otherwise.

\(d\) A certificate holder may continue to operate under this section without a program as required in paragraph (c) of this section, if it includes in its operations specifications a requirement that, any time conditions are such that frost, ice, or snow may reasonably be expected to adhere to the aircraft, no aircraft will take off unless it has been checked to ensure that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces are free of frost, ice, and snow. The check must occur within five minutes prior to beginning takeoff. This check must be accomplished from outside the aircraft.

\(a\) A certificate holder may specify any regular, provisional, or refueling airport, authorized for the type of aircraft, as a destination for the purpose of original dispatch or release.

\(b\) No person may allow a flight to continue to an airport to which it has been dispatched or released unless the weather conditions at an alternate airport that was specified in the dispatch or flight release are forecast to be at or above the alternate minimums specified in the operations specifications for that airport at the time the aircraft would arrive at the alternate airport. However, the dispatch or flight release may be amended en route to include any alternate airport that is within the fuel range of the aircraft as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.639   Fuel supply: All domestic operations.\|§§121.639]] through 121.647.

\(c\) No person may allow a flight to continue beyond the ETOPS Entry Point unless—

\(1\) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the weather conditions at each ETOPS Alternate Airport required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.624   ETOPS Alternate Airports.\|§121.624]] are forecast to be at or above the operating minima for that airport in the certificate holder's operations specifications when it might be used (from the earliest to the latest possible landing time); and

\(2\) All ETOPS Alternate Airports within the authorized ETOPS maximum diversion time are reviewed and the flight crew advised of any changes in conditions that have occurred since dispatch.

\(d\) If paragraph (c)(1) of this section cannot be met for a specific airport, the dispatch or flight release may be amended to add an ETOPS Alternate Airport within the maximum ETOPS diversion time that could be authorized for that flight with weather conditions at or above operating minima.

\(e\) Before the ETOPS Entry Point, the pilot in command for a supplemental operator or a dispatcher for a flag operator must use company communications to update the flight plan if needed because of a re-evaluation of aircraft system capabilities.

\(f\) No person may change an original destination or alternate airport that is specified in the original dispatch or flight release to another airport while the aircraft is en route unless the other airport is authorized for that type of aircraft and the appropriate requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.593   Dispatching authority: Domestic operations.\|§§121.593]] through 121.661 and 121.173 are met at the time of redispatch or amendment of the flight release.

\(g\) Each person who amends a dispatch or flight release en route shall record that amendment.

\(a\) For ETOPS up to and including 180 minutes, no person may list an airport as an ETOPS Alternate Airport in a dispatch or flight release if the time needed to fly to that airport (at the approved one-engine inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air) would exceed the approved time for the airplane's most limiting ETOPS Significant System (including the airplane's most limiting fire suppression system time for those cargo and baggage compartments required by regulation to have fire-suppression systems) minus 15 minutes.

\(b\) For ETOPS beyond 180 minutes, no person may list an airport as an ETOPS Alternate Airport in a dispatch or flight release if the time needed to fly to that airport:

\(1\) at the all engine operating cruise speed, corrected for wind and temperature, exceeds the airplane's most limiting fire suppression system time minus 15 minutes for those cargo and baggage compartments required by regulation to have fire suppression systems (except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), or

\(2\) at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed, corrected for wind and temperature, exceeds the airplane's most limiting ETOPS Significant System time (other than the airplane's most limiting fire suppression system time minus 15 minutes for those cargo and baggage compartments required by regulation to have fire-suppression systems).

\(2\) The airplane has enough fuel to fly to the Adequate Airport—

\(i\) Assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point;

\(ii\) Assuming a descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.333   Supplemental oxygen for emergency descent and for first aid; turbine engine powered airplanes with pressurized cabins.\|§121.333]]; and

\(iii\) Considering expected wind and other weather conditions.

\(3\) The airplane has enough fuel to hold for 15 minutes at 1500 feet above field elevation and conduct a normal approach and landing.

\(b\) No person may dispatch or release for flight an ETOPS flight unless, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, it has the fuel otherwise required by this part and enough fuel to satisfy each of the following requirements:

\(1\) Fuel to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport.

\(i\) Fuel to account for rapid decompression and engine failure. The airplane must carry the greater of the following amounts of fuel:

\(A\) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.333   Supplemental oxygen for emergency descent and for first aid; turbine engine powered airplanes with pressurized cabins.\|§121.333]] of this chapter;

\(B\) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed) assuming a rapid decompression and a simultaneous engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.333   Supplemental oxygen for emergency descent and for first aid; turbine engine powered airplanes with pressurized cabins.\|§121.333]] of this chapter; or

\(C\) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one engine inoperative cruise speed) assuming an engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to the one engine inoperative cruise altitude.

\(ii\) Fuel to account for errors in wind forecasting. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the certificate holder must increase the actual forecast wind speed by 5% (resulting in an increase in headwind or a decrease in tailwind) to account for any potential errors in wind forecasting. If a certificate holder is not using the actual forecast wind based on a wind model accepted by the FAA, the airplane must carry additional fuel equal to 5% of the fuel required for paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, as reserve fuel to allow for errors in wind data.

\(iii\) Fuel to account for icing. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), the certificate holder must ensure that the airplane carries the greater of the following amounts of fuel in anticipation of possible icing during the diversion:

\(A\) Fuel that would be burned as a result of airframe icing during 10 percent of the time icing is forecast (including the fuel used by engine and wing anti-ice during this period).

\(B\) Fuel that would be used for engine anti-ice, and if appropriate wing anti-ice, for the entire time during which icing is forecast.

\(iv\) Fuel to account for engine deterioration. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), the airplane also carries fuel equal to 5% of the fuel specified above, to account for deterioration in cruise fuel burn performance unless the certificate holder has a program to monitor airplane in-service deterioration to cruise fuel burn performance.

\(2\) Fuel to account for holding, approach, and landing. In addition to the fuel required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the airplane must carry fuel sufficient to hold at 1500 feet above field elevation for 15 minutes upon reaching an ETOPS Alternate Airport and then conduct an instrument approach and land.

\(3\) Fuel to account for APU use. If an APU is a required power source, the certificate holder must account for its fuel consumption during the appropriate phases of flight.

### §121.647   Factors for computing fuel required.

Each person computing fuel required for the purposes of this subpart shall consider the following:

\(a\) Wind and other weather conditions forecast.

\(b\) Anticipated traffic delays.

\(c\) One instrument approach and possible missed approach at destination.

\(d\) Any other conditions that may delay landing of the aircraft.

### §121.649   Takeoff and landing weather minimums: VFR: Domestic operations.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of any clearance from ATC, no pilot may takeoff or land an airplane under VFR when the reported ceiling or visibility is less than the following:

\(1\) For day operations—1,000-foot ceiling and one-mile visibility.

\(2\) For night operations—1,000-foot ceiling and two-mile visibility.

\(b\) Where a local surface restriction to visibility exists (e.g., smoke, dust, blowing snow or sand) the visibility for day and night operations may be reduced to 1⁄2 mile, if all turns after takeoff and prior to landing, and all flight beyond one mile from the airport boundary can be accomplished above or outside the area of local surface visibility restriction.

\(c\) The weather minimums in this section do not apply to the VFR operation of fixed-wing aircraft at any of the locations where the special weather minimums of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.157   Special VFR weather minimums.\|§91.157]] of this chapter are not applicable (See part 91, appendix D, section 3 of this chapter).

### §121.651   Takeoff and landing weather minimums: IFR: All certificate holders.

\(a\) Notwithstanding any clearance from ATC, no pilot may begin a takeoff in an airplane under IFR when the weather conditions reported by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by that Service, or a source approved by the Administrator, are less than those specified in—

\(1\) The certificate holder's operations specifications; or

\(2\) Parts 91 and 97 of this chapter, if the certificate holder's operations specifications do not specify takeoff minimums for the airport.

\(b\) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, no pilot may continue an approach past the final approach fix, or where a final approach fix is not used, begin the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure—

\(1\) At any airport, unless the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by that Service, or a source approved by the Administrator, issues a weather report for that airport; and

\(2\) At airports within the United States and its territories or at U.S. military airports, unless the latest weather report for that airport issued by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by that Service, or a source approved by the Administrator, reports the visibility to be equal to or more than the visibility minimums prescribed for that procedure. For the purpose of this section, the term “U.S. military airports” means airports in foreign countries where flight operations are under the control of U.S. military authority.

\(c\) A pilot who has begun the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and after that receives a later weather report indicating below-minimum conditions, may continue the approach to DA/DH or MDA. Upon reaching DA/DH or at MDA, and at any time before the missed approach point, the pilot may continue the approach below DA/DH or MDA if either the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.176   Straight-in landing operations below DA/DH or MDA using an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) under IFR.\|§91.176]] of this chapter, or the following requirements are met:

\(1\) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers, and where that descent rate will allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing;

\(2\) The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed in the standard instrument approach procedure being used;

\(3\) Except for Category II or Category III approaches where any necessary visual reference requirements are specified by authorization of the Administrator, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot:

\(i\) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.

\(ii\) The threshold.

\(iii\) The threshold markings.

\(iv\) The threshold lights.

\(v\) The runway end identifier lights.

\(vi\) The visual approach slope indicator.

\(vii\) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings.

\(viii\) The touchdown zone lights.

\(ix\) The runway or runway markings.

\(x\) The runway lights; and

\(4\) When the aircraft is on a straight-in nonprecision approach procedure which incorporates a visual descent point, the aircraft has reached the visual descent point, except where the aircraft is not equipped for or capable of establishing that point, or a descent to the runway cannot be made using normal procedures or rates of descent if descent is delayed until reaching that point.

\(d\) A pilot may begin the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure other than a Category II or Category III procedure at an airport when the visibility is less than the visibility minimums prescribed for that procedure if the airport is served by an operative ILS and an operative PAR, and both are used by the pilot. However, no pilot may continue an approach below the authorized DA/DH unless the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.176   Straight-in landing operations below DA/DH or MDA using an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) under IFR.\|§91.176]] of this chapter, or the following requirements are met:

\(1\) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers and where such a descent rate will allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing;

\(2\) The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed in the standard instrument approach procedure being used; and

\(3\) Except for Category II or Category III approaches where any necessary visual reference requirements are specified by the authorization of the Administrator, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot:

\(i\) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.

\(ii\) The threshold.

\(iii\) The threshold markings.

\(iv\) The threshold lights.

\(v\) The runway end identifier lights.

\(vi\) The visual approach slope indicator.

\(vii\) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings.

\(viii\) The touchdown zone lights.

\(ix\) The runway or runway markings.

\(x\) The runway lights.

\(e\) A pilot may begin the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure, or continue that approach procedure, at an airport when the visibility is reported to be less than the visibility minimums prescribed for that procedure if the pilot uses an operable EFVS in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.176   Straight-in landing operations below DA/DH or MDA using an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) under IFR.\|§91.176]] of this chapter and the certificate holder's operations specifications for EFVS operations.

\(f\) For the purpose of this section, the final approach segment begins at the final approach fix or facility prescribed in the instrument approach procedure.

### Appendix D to Part 121—Criteria for Demonstration of Emergency Evacuation Procedures Under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.291   Demonstration of emergency evacuation procedures.\|§121.291]]

\(a\) *Aborted takeoff demonstration.* (1) The demonstration must be conducted either during the dark of the night or during daylight with the dark of the night simulated. If the demonstration is conducted indoors during daylight hours, it must be conducted with each window covered and each door closed to minimize the daylight effect. Illumination on the floor or ground may be used, but it must be kept low and shielded against shining into the airplane's windows or doors.

\(2\) The airplane must be a normal ground attitude with landing gear extended.

\(3\) Unless the airplane is equipped with an off-wing descent means, stands or ramps may be used for descent from the wing to the ground. Safety equipment such as mats or inverted life rafts may be placed on the floor or ground to protect participants. No other equipment that is not part of the emergency evacuation equipment of the airplane may be used to aid the participants in reaching the ground.

\(4\) The airplane's normal electrical power sources must be deenergized.

\(5\) All emergency equipment for the type of passenger-carrying operation involved must be installed in accordance with the certificate holder's manual.

\(6\) Each external door and exit, and each internal door or curtain must be in position to simulate a normal takeoff.

\(7\) A representative passenger load of persons in normal health must be used. At least 40 percent of the passenger load must be females. At least 35 percent of the passenger load must be over 50 years of age. At least 15 percent of the passenger load must be female and over 50 year of age. Three life-size dolls, not included as part of the total passenger load, must be carried by passengers to simulate live infants 2 years old or younger. Crewmembers, mechanics, and training personnel, who maintain or operate the airplane in the normal course of their duties, may not be used as passengers.

\(8\) No passenger may be assigned a specific seat except as the Administrator may require. Except as required by item (12) of this paragraph, no employee of the certificate holder may be seated next to an emergency exit.

\(9\) Seat belts and shoulder harnesses (as required) must be fastened.

\(10\) Before the start of the demonstration, approximately one-half of the total average amount of carry-on baggage, blankets, pillows, and other similar articles must be distributed at several locations in the aisles and emergency exit access ways to create minor obstructions.

\(11\) The seating density and arrangement of the airplane must be representative of the highest capacity passenger version of that airplane the certificate holder operates or proposes to operate.

\(12\) Each crewmember must be a member of a regularly scheduled line crew, except that flight crewmembers need not be members of a regularly scheduled line crew, provided they have knowledge of the airplane. Each crewmember must be seated in the seat the crewmember is normally assigned for takeoff, and must remain in that seat until the signal for commencement of the demonstration is received.

\(13\) No crewmember or passenger may be given prior knowledge of the emergency exits available for the demonstration.

\(14\) The certificate holder may not practice, rehearse, or describe the demonstration for the participants nor may any participant have taken part in this type of demonstration within the preceding 6 months.

\(15\) The pretakeoff passenger briefing required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.571   Briefing passengers before takeoff.\|§121.571]] may be given in accordance with the certificate holder's manual. The passengers may also be warned to follow directions of crewmembers, but may not be instructed on the procedures to be followed in the demonstration.

\(16\) If safety equipment as allowed by item (3) of this section is provided, either all passenger and cockpit windows must be blacked out or all of the emergency exits must have safety equipment in order to prevent disclosure of the available emergency exits.

\(17\) Not more than 50 percent of the emergency exits in the sides of the fuselage of an airplane that meet all of the requirements applicable to the required emergency exits for that airplane may be used for the demonstration. Exits that are not to be used in the demonstration must have the exit handle deactivated or must be indicated by red lights, red tape, or other acceptable means, placed outside the exits to indicate fire or other reason that they are unusable. The exits to be used must be representative of all of the emergency exits on the airplane and must be designated by the certificate holder, subject to approval by the Administrator. At least one floor level exit must be used.

\(18\) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix, all evacuees must leave the airplane by a means provided as part of the airplane's equipment.

\(19\) The certificate holder's approved procedures and all of the emergency equipment that is normally available, including slides, ropes, lights, and megaphones, must be fully utilized during the demonstration, except that the flightcrew must take no active role in assisting others inside the cabin during the demonstration.

\(20\) The evacuation time period is completed when the last occupant has evacuated the airplane and is on the ground. Evacuees using stands or ramps allowed by item (3) above are considered to be on the ground when they are on the stand or ramp: *Provided,* That the acceptance rate of the stand or ramp is no greater than the acceptance rate of the means available on the airplane for descent from the wing during an actual crash situation.

\(b\) *Ditching demonstration.* The demonstration must assume that daylight hours exist outside the airplane, and that all required crewmembers are available for the demonstration.

\(1\) If the certificate holder's manual requires the use of passengers to assist in the launching of liferafts, the needed passengers must be aboard the airplane and participate in the demonstration according to the manual.

\(2\) A stand must be placed at each emergency exit and wing, with the top of the platform at a height simulating the water level of the airplane following a ditching.

\(3\) After the ditching signal has been received, each evacuee must don a life vest according to the certificate holder's manual.

\(4\) Each liferaft must be launched and inflated, according to the certificate holder's manual, and all other required emergency equipment must be placed in rafts.

\(5\) Each evacuee must enter a liferaft, and the crewmembers assigned to each liferaft must indicate the location of emergency equipment aboard the raft and describe its use.

\(6\) Either the airplane, a mockup of the airplane or a floating device simulating a passenger compartment must be used.

\(i\) If a mockup of the airplane is used, it must be a life-size mockup of the interior and representative of the airplane currently used by or proposed to be used by the certificate holder, and must contain adequate seats for use of the evacuees. Operation of the emergency exits and the doors must closely simulate those on the airplane. Sufficient wing area must be installed outside the over-the-wing exits to demonstrate the evacuation.

\(ii\) If a floating device simulating a passenger compartment is used, it must be representative, to the extent possible, of the passenger compartment of the airplane used in operations. Operation of the emergency exits and the doors must closely simulate operation on that airplane. Sufficient wing area must be installed outside the over-the-wing exits to demonstrate the evacuation. The device must be equipped with the same survival equipment as is installed on the airplane, to accommodate all persons participating in the demonstration.

### Appendix F to Part 121—Proficiency Check Requirements

\(a\) The maneuvers and procedures required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.441   Proficiency checks.\|§121.441]] for pilot proficiency checks are set forth in this appendix. Except for the equipment examination, these maneuvers and procedures must be performed inflight. Certain maneuvers and procedures may be performed in an FFS or an FTD as indicated by the appropriate symbol in the respective column opposite the maneuver or procedure.

\(b\) Whenever a maneuver or procedure is authorized to be performed in an FTD, it may be performed in an FFS.

\(c\) A Level B or higher FFS may be used instead of the airplane to satisfy the inflight requirements if the FFS is approved under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.407   Training program: Approval of flight simulation training devices.\|§121.407]] and is used as part of an approved program that meets the requirements for an Advanced Simulation Training Program in Appendix H of this part.

\(d\) For the purpose of this appendix, the following symbols mean—

B = Both Pilot in Command (PIC) and Second in Command (SIC).

W = May be waived for both PIC and SIC, except during a proficiency check conducted to qualify a PIC after completing an upgrade training curriculum in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.420   Pilots: Upgrade ground training.\|§§121.420]] and 121.426.

\* = A symbol and asterisk (B\* or W\*) indicates that a particular condition is specified in the maneuvers and procedures column.

\# = When a maneuver is preceded by this symbol it indicates the maneuver may be required in the airplane at the discretion of the person conducting the check.

\(e\) Throughout the maneuvers and procedures prescribed in this appendix, good judgment commensurate with a high level of safety must be demonstrated. In determining whether such judgment has been shown, the person conducting the check considers adherence to approved procedures, actions based on analysis of situations for which there is no prescribed procedure or recommended practice, and qualities of prudence and care in selecting a course of action.

### Appendix N to Part 121 \[Reserved\]

### Appendix O to Part 121—Hazardous Materials Training Requirements For Certificate Holders

This appendix prescribes the requirements for hazardous materials training under part 121, subpart Z, and part 135, subpart K of this chapter. The training requirements for various categories of persons are defined by job function or responsibility. An “X” in a box under a category of persons indicates that the specified category must receive the noted training. All training requirements apply to direct supervisors as well as to persons actually performing the job function. Training requirements for certificate holders authorized in their operations specifications to transport hazardous materials (will-carry) are prescribed in Table 1. Those certificate holders with a prohibition in their operations specifications against carrying or handling hazardous materials (will-not-carry) must follow the curriculum prescribed in Table 2. The method of delivering the training will be determined by the certificate holder. The certificate holder is responsible for providing a method (may include email, telecommunication, etc.) to answer all questions prior to testing regardless of the method of instruction. The certificate holder must certify that a test has been completed satisfactorily to verify understanding of the regulations and requirements.

\(5\) The certificate holder must track how many times 207-minute authority is used.

\(i\) *240-minute ETOPS in the North Polar Area, in the area north of the NOPAC, and in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator.* (1) The FAA grants approval to conduct 240-minute ETOPS authority with maximum diversion times in the North Polar Area, in the area north of the NOPAC area, and the Pacific Ocean area north of the equator as an extension to 180-minute ETOPS authority to be used on an exception basis. This exception may be used only on a flight-by-flight basis when an ETOPS Alternate Airport is not available within 180 minutes. In that case, the nearest available ETOPS Alternate Airport within 240 minutes diversion time must be specified in the dispatch or flight release.

\(2\) This exception may be used in the North Polar Area and in the area north of NOPAC only in extreme conditions particular to these areas such as volcanic activity, extreme cold weather at en-route airports, airport weather below dispatch requirements, temporary airport conditions, and other weather related events. The criteria used by the certificate holder to decide that extreme weather precludes using an airport must be established by the certificate holder, accepted by the FAA, and published in the certificate holder's manual for the use of dispatchers and pilots.

\(3\) This exception may be used in the Pacific Ocean area north of the equator only for reasons such as political or military concern, volcanic activity, airport weather below dispatch requirements, temporary airport conditions and other weather related events.

\(4\) The airplane-engine combination must be type design approved for ETOPS greater than 180 minutes.

\(j\) *240-minute ETOPS in areas South of the equator.* (1) The FAA grants approval to conduct ETOPS with maximum diversion times of up to 240 minutes in the following areas:

\(i\) Pacific oceanic areas between the U.S. West coast and Australia, New Zealand and Polynesia.

\(ii\) South Atlantic oceanic areas.

\(iii\) Indian Ocean areas.

\(iv\) Oceanic areas between Australia and South America.

\(2\) The operator must designate the nearest available ETOPS Alternate Airports along the planned route of flight.

\(3\) The airplane-engine combination must be type-design-approved for ETOPS greater than 180 minutes.

\(k\) *ETOPS beyond 240 minutes.* (1) The FAA grants approval to conduct ETOPS with diversion times beyond 240 minutes for operations between specified city pairs on routes in the following areas:

\(i\) The Pacific oceanic areas between the U.S. west coast and Australia, New Zealand, and Polynesia;

\(ii\) The South Atlantic oceanic areas;

\(iii\) The Indian Oceanic areas; and

\(iv\) The oceanic areas between Australia and South America, and the South Polar Area.

\(2\) This approval is granted to certificate holders who have been operating under 180-minute or greater ETOPS authority for at least 24 consecutive months, of which at least 12 consecutive months must be under 240-minute ETOPS authority with the airplane-engine combination to be used.

\(3\) The operator must designate the nearest available ETOPS alternate or alternates along the planned route of flight.

\(4\) For these operations, the airplane-engine combination must be type-design-approved for ETOPS greater than 180 minutes.

Section II. *ETOPS Approval: Passenger-carrying Airplanes With More Than Two Engines.*

\(a\) The FAA grants approval to conduct ETOPS, as follows:

\(1\) Except as provided in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.162   ETOPS Type Design Approval Basis.\|§121.162]], the airplane-engine combination must be type-design-approved for ETOPS.

\(2\) The operator must designate the nearest available ETOPS Alternate Airports within 240 minutes diversion time (at one-engine-inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air). If an ETOPS alternate is not available within 240 minutes, the operator must designate the nearest available ETOPS Alternate Airports along the planned route of flight.

\(3\) The MEL limitations for the authorized ETOPS diversion time apply.

\(i\) The Fuel Quantity Indicating System must be operational.

\(ii\) The communications systems required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.99   Communications facilities—domestic and flag operations.\|§121.99]](d) or [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations#§121.122   Communications facilities—supplemental operations.\|§121.122]](c) must be operational.

\(4\) The certificate holder must operate in accordance with the ETOPS authority as contained in its operations specifications.

Section III. *Approvals for operations whose airplane routes are planned to traverse either the North Polar or South Polar Areas.*

\(a\) Except for intrastate operations within the State of Alaska, no certificate holder may operate an aircraft in the North Polar Area or South Polar Area, unless authorized by the FAA.

\(b\) In addition to any of the applicable requirements of sections I and II of this appendix, the certificate holder's operations specifications must contain the following:

\(1\) The designation of airports that may be used for en-route diversions and the requirements the airports must meet at the time of diversion.

\(2\) Except for supplemental all-cargo operations, a recovery plan for passengers at designated diversion airports.

\(3\) A fuel-freeze strategy and procedures for monitoring fuel freezing.

\(4\) A plan to ensure communication capability for these operations.

\(5\) An MEL for these operations.

\(6\) A training plan for operations in these areas.

\(7\) A plan for mitigating crew exposure to radiation during solar flare activity.

\(8\) A plan for providing at least two cold weather anti-exposure suits in the aircraft, to protect crewmembers during outside activity at a diversion airport with extreme climatic conditions. The FAA may relieve the certificate holder from this requirement if the season of the year makes the equipment unnecessary.

## Subpart A—General Provisions

### §150.1   Scope and purpose.

This part prescribes the procedures, standards, and methodology governing the development, submission, and review of airport noise exposure maps and airport noise compatibility programs, including the process for evaluating and approving or disapproving those programs. It prescribes single systems for—(a) measuring noise at airports and surrounding areas that generally provides a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reaction of people to noise; and (b) determining exposure of individuals to noise that results from the operations of an airport. This part also identifies those land uses which are normally compatible with various levels of exposure to noise by individuals. It provides technical assistance to airport operators, in conjunction with other local, State, and Federal authorities, to prepare and execute appropriate noise compatibility planning and implementation programs.

### §150.3   Applicability.

This part applies to the airport noise compatibility planning activities of the operators of “public use airports,” including heliports, as that term is used in section 47501(2) as amended (49 U.S.C. 47501 *et seq.*) and as defined in section 47102(17) of 49 U.S.C.

\[Doc. No. FAA-2004-19158, 69 FR 57625, Sept. 24, 2004\]

### §150.5   Limitations of this part.

\(a\) Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 47501 *et seq.,* this part provides for airport noise compatibility planning and land use programs necessary to the purposes of those provisions. No submittal of a map, or approval or disapproval, in whole or part, of any map or program submitted under this part is a determination concerning the acceptability or unacceptability of that land use under Federal, State, or local law.

\(b\) Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part is neither a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program, nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA.

\(c\) Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332 *et seq.*) and guidelines.

\(d\) Acceptance of a noise exposure map does not constitute an FAA determination that any specific parcel of land lies within a particular noise contour. Responsibility for interpretation of the effects of noise contours upon subjacent land uses, including the relationship between noise contours and specific properties, rests with the sponsor or with other state or local government.

\[Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-4, 69 FR 57625, Sept. 24, 2004\]

### §150.7   Definitions.

As used in this part, unless the context requires otherwise, the following terms have the following meanings.

*Airport* means any public use airport, including heliports, as defined by the ASNA Act, including: (a) Any airport which is used or to be used for public purposes, under the control of a public agency, the landing area of which is publicly owned; (b) any privately owned reliever airport; and (c) any privately owned airport which is determined by the Secretary to enplane annually 2,500 or more passengers and receive scheduled passenger service of aircraft, which is used or to be used for public purposes.

*Airport noise compatibility program* and *program* mean that program, and all revisions thereto, reflected in documents (and revised documents) developed in accordance with appendix B of this part, including the measures proposed or taken by the airport operator to reduce existing noncompatible land uses and to prevent the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses within the area.

*Airport Operator* means, the operator of an airport as defined in the ASNA Act.

*ASNA Act* means 49 U.S.C. 47501 *et seq.*

*Average sound level* means the level, in decibels, of the mean-square, A-weighted sound pressure during a specified period, with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals.

*Compatible land use* means the use of land that is identified under this part as normally compatible with the outdoor noise environment (or an adequately attenuated noise level reduction for any indoor activities involved) at the location because the yearly day-night average sound level is at or below that identified for that or similar use under appendix A (Table 1) of this part.

*Day-night average sound level* (DNL) means the 24-hour average sound level, in decibels, for the period from midnight to midnight, obtained after the addition of ten decibels to sound levels for the periods between midnight and 7 a.m., and between 10 p.m., and midnight, local time. The symbol for DNL is Ldn.

*Noise exposure map* means a scaled, geographic depiction of an airport, its noise contours, and surrounding area developed in accordance with section A150.1 of Appendix A of this part, including the accompanying documentation setting forth the required descriptions of forecast aircraft operations at that airport during the fifth calendar year (or later) beginning after submission of the map, together with the ways, if any, those operations will affect the map (including noise contours and the forecast land uses).

*Noise level reduction* (NLR) means the amount of noise level reduction in decibels achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation (between outdoor and indoor levels) in the design and construction of a structure.

*Noncompatible land use* means the use of land that is identified under this part as normally not compatible with the outdoor noise environment (or an adequately attenuated noise reduction level for the indoor activities involved at the location) because the yearly day-night average sound level is above that identified for that or similar use under appendix A (Table 1) of this part.

*Regional Airports Division Manager* means the Airports Division Manager having responsibility for the geographic area in which the airport in question is located.

*Restriction affecting flight procedures* means any requirement, limitation, or other action affecting the operation of aircraft, in the air or on the ground.

*Sound exposure level* means the level, in decibels, of the time integral of squared A-weighted sound pressure during a specified period or event, with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals and a duration of one second.

*Yearly day-night average sound level* (YDNL) means the 365-day average, in decibels, day-night average sound level. The symbol for YDNL is also Ldn.

### §150.9   Designation of noise systems.

For purposes of this part, the following designations apply:

\(a\) The noise at an airport and surrounding areas covered by a noise exposure map must be measured in A-weighted sound pressure level (LA) in units of decibels (dBA) in accordance with the specifications and methods prescribed under appendix A of this part.

\(b\) The exposure of individuals to noise resulting from the operation of an airport must be established in terms of yearly day-night average sound level (YDNL) calculated in accordance with the specifications and methods prescribed under appendix A of this part.

\(c\) Uses of computer models to create noise contours must be in accordance with the criteria prescribed under appendix A of this part.

### §150.11   Identification of land uses.

For the purposes of this part, uses of land which are normally compatible or noncompatible with various noise exposure levels to individuals around airports must be identified in accordance with the criteria prescribed under appendix A of this part. Determination of land use must be based on professional planning criteria and procedures utilizing comprehensive, or master, land use planning, zoning, and building and site designing, as appropriate. If more than one current or future land use is permissible, determination of compatibility must be based on that use most adversely affected by noise.

### §150.13   Incorporations by reference.

\(a\) *General.* This part prescribes certain standards and procedures which are not set forth in full text in the rule. Those standards and procedures are hereby incorporated by reference and were approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

## Subpart B—Development of Noise Exposure Maps and Noise Compatibility Programs

### §150.21   Noise exposure maps and related descriptions.

\(a\) Each airport operator may after completion of the consultations and public procedure specified under paragraph (b) of this section submit to the Regional Airports Division Manager five copies of the noise exposure map (or revised map) which identifies each noncompatible land use in each area depicted on the map, as of the date of submission, and five copies of a map each with accompanying documentation setting forth—

\(1\) The noise exposure based on forecast aircraft operations at the airport for a forecast period that is at least 5 years in the future, beginning after the date of submission (based on reasonable assumptions concerning future type and frequency of aircraft operations, number of nighttime operations, flight patterns, airport layout including any planned airport development, planned land use changes, and demographic changes in the surrounding areas); and

\(2\) The nature and extent, if any, to which those forecast operations will affect the compatibility and land uses depicted on the map.

\(b\) Each map, and related documentation submitted under this section must be developed and prepared in accordance with appendix A of this part, or an FAA approved equivalent, and in consultation with states, and public agencies and planning agencies whose area, or any portion of whose area, of jurisdiction is within the Ldn 65 dB contour depicted on the map, FAA regional officials, and other Federal officials having local responsibility for land uses depicted on the map. This consultation must include regular aeronautical users of the airport. The airport operator shall certify that it has afforded interested persons adequate opportunity to submit their views, data, and comments concerning the correctness and adequacy of the draft noise exposure map and descriptions of forecast aircraft operations. Each map and revised map must be accompanied by documentation describing the consultation accomplished under this paragraph and the opportunities afforded the public to review and comment during the development of the map. One copy of all written comments received during consultation shall also be filed with the Regional Airports Division Manager.

\(c\) The Regional Airports Division Manager acknowledges receipt of noise exposure maps and descriptions and indicates whether they are in compliance with the applicable requirements. The Regional Airports Division Manager publishes in the Federal Register a notice of compliance for each such noise exposure map and description, identifying the airport involved. Such notice includes information as to when and where the map and related documentation are available for public inspection.

\(d\) The airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map.

\(1\) If, after submission of a noise exposure map under paragraph (a) of this section, any change in the operation of the airport would create any “substantial, new noncompatible use” in any area depicted on the map beyond that which is forecast for a period of at least five years after the date of submission, the airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map. A change in the operation of an airport creates a substantial new noncompatible use if that change results in an increase in the yearly day-night average sound level of 1.5 dB or greater in either a land area which was formerly compatible but is thereby made noncompatible under Appendix A (Table 1), or in a land area which was previously determined to be noncompatible under that Table and whose noncompatibility is now significantly increased.

\(2\) If, after submission of a noise exposure map under paragraph (a) of this section, any change in the operation of the airport would significantly reduce noise over existing noncompatible uses that is not reflected in either the existing conditions or forecast noise exposure map on file with the FAA, the airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map. A change in the operation of the airport creates a significant reduction in noise over existing noncompatible uses if that change results in a decrease in the yearly day-night average sound level of 1.5 dB or greater in a land area which was formerly noncompatible but is thereby made compatible under Appendix A (Table 1).

\(3\) Such updating of the map shall include a reassessment of those areas excluded under section A150.101(e)(5) of Appendix A because of high ambient noise levels.

\(4\) If the forecast map is based on assumptions involving recommendations in a noise compatibility program which are subsequently disapproved by the FAA, a revised map must be submitted if revised assumptions would create a substantial, new noncompatible use not indicated on the forecast map. Revised noise exposure maps are subject to the same requirements and procedures as initial submissions of noise exposure maps under this part.

\(e\) Each map, or revised map, and description of consultation and opportunity for public comment, submitted to the FAA, must be certified as true and complete under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

(f)(1) Title 49, section 47506 provides that no person who acquires property or an interest therein after the date of enactment of the Act in an area surrounding an airport with respect to which a noise exposure map has been submitted under section 47503 of the Act shall be entitled to recover damages with respect to the noise attributable to such airport if such person had actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of such noise exposure map unless, in addition to any other elements for recovery of damages, such person can show that—

(f)(2) Title 49 section 47506(b) further provides:

\(g\) For this purpose, the term *significant* in paragraph (f) of this section means that change or increase in one or more of the four factors which results in a “substantial new noncompatible use” as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.21   Noise exposure maps and related descriptions.\|§150.21]](d), affecting the property in issue. Responsibility for applying or interpreting this provision with respect to specific properties rests with local government.

\[Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 1, 1984; 50 FR 5063, Feb. 6, 1985; Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989; Amdt. 150-4, 69 FR 57626, Sept. 24, 2004\]

### §150.23   Noise compatibility programs.

\(a\) Any airport operator who has submitted an acceptable noise exposure map under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.21   Noise exposure maps and related descriptions.\|§150.21]] may, after FAA notice of acceptability and other consultation and public procedure specified under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, as applicable, submit to the Regional Airports Division Manager five copies of a noise compatibility program.

\(b\) An airport operator may submit the noise compatibility program at the same time as the noise exposure map. In this case, the Regional Airports Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day review period (for the program) until after FAA reviews the noise exposure map and finds that it and its supporting documentation are in compliance with the applicable requirements.

\(c\) Each noise compatibility program must be developed and prepared in accordance with appendix B of this part, or an FAA approved equivalent, and in consultation with FAA regional officials, the officials of the state and of any public agencies and planning agencies whose area, or any portion or whose area, of jurisdiction within the Ldn 65 dB noise contours is depicted on the noise exposure map, and other Federal officials having local responsibility of land uses depicted on the map. Consultation with FAA regional officials shall include, to the extent practicable, informal agreement from FAA on proposed new or modified flight procedures. For air carrier airports, consultation must include any air carriers and, to the extent practicable, other aircraft operators using the airport. For other airports, consultation must include, to the extent practicable, aircraft operators using the airport.

\(d\) Prior to and during the development of a program, and prior to submission of the resulting draft program to the FAA, the airport operator shall afford adequate opportunity for the active and direct participation of the States, public agencies and planning agencies in the areas surrounding the airport, aeronautical users of the airport, the airport operator, and the general public to submit their views, data, and comments on the formulation and adequacy of that program. Prior to submitting the program to the FAA, the airport operator shall also provide notice and the opportunity for a public hearing.

\(e\) Each noise compatibility program submitted to the FAA must consist of at least the following:

\(1\) A copy of the noise exposure map and its supporting documentation as found in compliance with the applicable requirements by the FAA, per [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.21   Noise exposure maps and related descriptions.\|§150.21]](c).

\(2\) A description and analysis of the alternative measures considered by the airport operator in developing the program, together with a discussion of why each rejected measure was not included in the program.

\(3\) Program measures proposed to reduce or eliminate present and future noncompatible land uses and a description of the relative contribution of each of the proposed measures to the overall effectiveness of the program.

\(4\) A description of public participation and the consultation with officials of public agencies and planning agencies in areas surrounding the airport, FAA regional officials and other Federal officials having local responsibility for land uses depicted on the map, any air carriers and other users of the airport.

\(5\) The actual or anticipated effect of the program on reducing noise exposure to individuals and noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible uses within the area covered by the noise exposure map. The effects must be based on expressed assumptions concerning the type and frequency of aircraft operations, number of nighttime operations, flight patterns, airport layout including planned airport development, planned land use changes, and demographic changes within the Ldn 65 dB noise contours.

\(6\) A description of how the proposed future actions may change any noise control or compatibility plans or actions previously adopted by the airport proprietor.

\(7\) A summary of the comments at any public hearing on the program and a copy of all written material submitted to the operator under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, together with the operator's response and disposition of those comments and materials to demonstrate the program is feasible and reasonably consistent with obtaining the objectives of airport noise compatibility planning under this part.

\(8\) The period covered by the program, the schedule for implementation of the program, the persons responsible for implementation of each measure in the program, and, for each measure, documentation supporting the feasibility of implementation, including any essential governmental actions, costs, and anticipated sources of funding, that will demonstrate that the program is reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of airport noise compatibility planning under this part.

\(9\) Provision for revising the program if made necessary by revision of the noise exposure map.

\[Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984; 50 FR 5063, Feb. 6, 1985; Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989; Amdt. 150-4, 69 FR 57626, Sept. 24, 2004\]

## Subpart C—Evaluations and Determinations of Effects of Noise Compatibility Programs

### §150.31   Preliminary review: Acknowledgments.

\(a\) Upon receipt of a noise compatibility program submitted under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.23   Noise compatibility programs.\|§150.23]], the Regional Airports Division Manager acknowledges to the airport operator receipt of the program and conducts a preliminary review of the submission.

\(b\) If, based on the preliminary review, the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the submission does not conform to the requirements of this part, he disapproves and returns the unacceptable program to the airport operator for reconsideration and development of a program in accordance with this part.

\(c\) If, based on the preliminary review, the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the program conforms to the requirements of this part, the Regional Airports Division Manager publishes in the Federal Register a notice of receipt of the program for comment which indicates the following:

\(1\) The airport covered by the program, and the date of receipt.

\(2\) The availability of the program for examination in the offices of the Regional Airports Division Manager and the airport operator.

\(3\) That comments on the program are invited and, will be considered by the FAA.

\(d\) The date of signature of the published notice of receipt starts the 180-day approval period for the program.

\[Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989\]

### §150.33   Evaluation of programs.

\(a\) The FAA conducts an evaluation of each noise compatibility program and, based on that evaluation, either approves or disapproves the program. The evaluation includes consideration of proposed measures to determine whether they—

\(1\) May create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce (including unjust discrimination);

\(2\) Are reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; and

\(3\) Include the use of new or modified flight procedures to control the operation of aircraft for purposes of noise control, or affect flight procedures in any way.

\(b\) The evaluation may also include an evaluation of those proposed measures to determine whether they may adversely affect the exercise of the authority and responsibilities of the Administrator under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended.

\(c\) To the extent considered necessary, the FAA may—

\(1\) Confer with the airport operator and other persons known to have information and views material to the evaluation;

\(2\) Explore the objectives of the program and the measures, and any alternative measures, for achieving the objectives.

\(3\) Examine the program for developing a range of alternatives that would eliminate the reasons, if any, for disapproving the program.

\(4\) Convene an informal meeting with the airport operator and other persons involved in developing or implementing the program for the purposes of gathering all facts relevant to the determination of approval or disapproval of the program and of discussing any needs to accommodate or modify the program as submitted.

\(d\) If requested by the FAA, the airport operator shall furnish all information needed to complete FAA's review under (c).

\(e\) An airport operator may, at any time before approval or disapproval of a program, withdraw or revise the program. If the airport operator withdraws or revises the program or indicates to the Regional Airports Division Manager, in writing, the intention to revise the program, the Regional Airports Division Manager terminates the evaluation and notifies the airport operator of that action. That termination cancels the 180-day review period. The FAA does not evaluate a second program for any airport until any previously submitted program has been withdrawn or a determination on it is issued. A new evaluation is commenced upon receipt of a revised program, and a new 180-day approval period is begun, unless the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the modification made, in light of the overall revised program, can be integrated into the unmodified portions of the revised program without exceeding the original 180-day approval period or causing undue expense to the government.

\[Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989\]

### §150.35   Determinations; publications; effectivity.

\(a\) The FAA issues a determination approving or disapproving each airport noise compatibility program (and revised program). Portions of a program may be individually approved or disapproved. No conditional approvals will be issued. A determination on a program acceptable under this part is issued within 180 days after the program is received under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.23   Noise compatibility programs.\|§150.23]] of this part or it may be considered approved, except that this time period may be exceeded for any portion of a program relating to the use of flight procedures for noise control purposes. A determination on portions of a program covered by the exceptions to the 180-day review period for approval will be issued within a reasonable time after receipt of the program. Determinations relating to the use of any flight procedure for noise control purposes may be issued either in connection with the determination on other portions of the program or separately. Except as provided by this paragraph, no approval of any noise compatibility program, or any portion of a program, may be implied in the absence of the FAA's express approval.

\(b\) The Administrator approves programs under this part, if—

\(1\) It is found that the program measures to be implemented would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce (including any unjust discrimination) and are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and of preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

\(2\) The program provides for revision if made necessary by the revision of the noise map; and

\(3\) Those aspects of programs relating to the use of flight procedures for noise control can be implemented within the period covered by the program and without—

\(i\) Reducing the level of aviation safety provided;

\(ii\) Derogating the requisite level of protection for aircraft, their occupants and persons and property on the ground;

\(iii\) Adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the Navigable Airspace and Air Traffic Control Systems; or

\(iv\) Adversely affecting any other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law or any other program, standard, or requirement established in accordance with law.

\(c\) When a determination is issued, the Regional Airports Division Manager notifies the airport operator and publishes a notice of approval or disapproval in the Federal Register identifying the nature and extent of the determination.

\(d\) Approvals issued under this part for a program or portion thereof become effective as specified therein and may be withdrawn when one of the following occurs:

\(1\) The program or portion thereof is required to be revised under this part or under its own terms, and is not so revised;

\(2\) If a revision has been submitted for approval, a determination is issued on the revised program or portion thereof, that is inconsistent with the prior approval.

\(3\) A term or condition of the program, or portion thereof, or its approval is violated by the responsible government body.

\(4\) A flight procedure or other FAA action upon which the approved program or portion thereof is dependent is subsequently disapproved, significantly altered, or rescinded by the FAA.

\(5\) The airport operator requests rescission of the approval.

\(6\) Impacts on flight procedures, air traffic management, or air commerce occur which could not be foreseen at the time of approval.

\(e\) Determinations may contain conditions which must be satisfied prior to implementation of any portion of the program relating to flight procedures affecting airport or aircraft operations.

\(f\) Noise exposure maps for current and forecast year map conditions that are submitted and approved with noise compatibility programs are considered to be the new FAA accepted noise exposure maps for purposes of part 150.

# Part A—General

### Sec. A150.1   Purpose.

\(a\) This appendix establishes a uniform methodology for the development and preparation of airport noise exposure maps. That methodology includes a single system of measuring noise at airports for which there is a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reactions of people to noise along with a separate single system for determining the exposure of individuals to noise. It also identifies land uses which, for the purpose of this part are considered to be compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise around airports.

\(b\) This appendix provides for the use of the FAA's Integrated Noise Model (INM) or an FAA approved equivalent, for developing standardized noise exposure maps and predicting noise impacts. Noise monitoring may be utilized by airport operators for data acquisition and data refinement, but is not required by this part for the development of noise exposure maps or airport noise compatibility programs. Whenever noise monitoring is used, under this part, it should be accomplished in accordance with Sec. A150.5 of this appendix.

### Sec. A150.3   Noise descriptors.

\(a\) *Airport Noise Measurement.* The A-Weighted Sound Level, measured, filtered and recorded in accordance with Sec. A150.5 of this appendix, must be employed as the unit for the measurement of single event noise at airports and in the areas surrounding the airports.

\(b\) *Airport Noise Exposure.* The yearly day-night average sound level (YDNL) must be employed for the analysis and characterization of multiple aircraft noise events and for determining the cumulative exposure of individuals to noise around airports.

### Sec. A150.5   Noise measurement procedures and equipment.

\(a\) Sound levels must be measured or analyzed with equipment having the “A” frequency weighting, filter characteristics, and the “slow response” characteristics as defined in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Publication No. 179, entitled “Precision Sound Level Meters” as incorporated by reference in part 150 under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.11   Identification of land uses.\|§150.11]]. For purposes of this part, the tolerances allowed for general purpose, type 2 sound level meters in IEU 179, are acceptable.

\(b\) Noise measurements and documentation must be in accordance with accepted acoustical measurement methodology, such as those described in American National Standards Institute publication ANSI 51.13, dated 1971 as revised 1979, entitled “ANS—Methods for the Measurement of Sound Pressure Levels”; ARP No. 796, dated 1969, entitled “Measurement of Aircraft Exterior Noise in the Field”; “Handbook of Noise Measurement,” Ninth Ed. 1980, by Arnold P.G. Peterson; or “Acoustic Noise Measurement,” dated Jan., 1979, by J.R. Hassell and K. Zaveri. For purposes of this part, measurements intended for comparison to a State or local standard or with another transportation noise source (including other aircraft) must be reported in maximum A-weighted sound levels (LAM); for computation or validation of the yearly day-night average level (Ldn), measurements must be reported in sound exposure level (LAE), as defined in Sec. A150.205 of this appendix.

# Part B—Noise Exposure Map Development

### Sec. A150.101   Noise contours and land usages.

\(a\) To determine the extent of the noise impact around an airport, airport proprietors developing noise exposure maps in accordance with this part must develop Ldn contours. Continuous contours must be developed for YDNL levels of 65, 70, and 75 (additional contours may be developed and depicted when appropriate). In those areas where YDNL values are 65 YDNL or greater, the airport operator shall identify land uses and determine land use compatibility in accordance with the standards and procedures of this appendix.

\(b\) Table 1 of this appendix describes compatible land use information for several land uses as a function of YDNL values. The ranges of YDNL values in Table 1 reflect the statistical variability for the responses of large groups of people to noise. Any particular level might not, therefore, accurately assess an individual's perception of an actual noise environment. Compatible or noncompatible land use is determined by comparing the predicted or measured YDNL values at a site with the values given. Adjustments or modifications of the descriptions of the land-use categories may be desirable after consideration of specific local conditions.

\(c\) Compatibility designations in Table 1 generally refer to the major use of the site. If other uses with greater sensitivity to noise are permitted by local government at a site, a determination of compatibility must be based on that use which is most adversely affected by noise. When appropriate, noise level reduction through incorporation of sound attenuation into the design and construction of a structure may be necessary to achieve compatibility.

\(d\) For the purpose of compliance with this part, all land uses are considered to be compatible with noise levels less than Ldn 65 dB. Local needs or values may dictate further delineation based on local requirements or determinations.

\(e\) Except as provided in (f) below, the noise exposure maps must also contain and indentify:

\(1\) Runway locations.

\(2\) Flight tracks.

\(3\) Noise contours of Ldn 65, 70, and 75 dB resulting from aircraft operations.

\(4\) Outline of the airport boundaries.

\(5\) Noncompatible land uses within the noise contours, including those within the Ldn 65 dB contours. (No land use has to be identified as noncompatible if the self-generated noise from that use and/or the ambient noise from other nonaircraft and nonairport uses is equal to or greater than the noise from aircraft and airport sources.)

\(6\) Location of noise sensitive public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and health care facilities), and properties on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.

\(7\) Locations of any aircraft noise monitoring sites utilized for data acquisition and refinement procedures.

\(8\) Estimates of the number of people residing within the Ldn 65, 70, and 75 dB contours.

\(9\) Depiction of the required noise contours over a land use map of a sufficient scale and quality to discern streets and other identifiable geographic features.

\(f\) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, noise exposure maps prepared in connection with studies which were either Federally funded or Federally approved and which commenced before October 1, 1981, are not required to be modified to contain the following items:

\(1\) Flight tracks depicted on the map.

\(2\) Use of ambient noise to determine land use compatibility.

\(3\) The Ldn 70 dB noise contour and data related to Ldn 70 dB contour. When determinations on land use compatibility using Table 1 differ between Ldn 65-70 dB and the Ldn 70-75 dB, determinations should either use the more conservative Ldn 70-75 dB column or reflect determinations based on local needs and values.

\(4\) Estimates of the number of people residing within the Ldn 65, 70, and 75 dB contours.

Numbers in parentheses refer to notes.

\*The designations contained in this table do not constitute a Federal determination that any use of land covered by the program is acceptable or unacceptable under Federal, State, or local law. The responsibility for determining the acceptable and permissible land uses and the relationship between specific properties and specific noise contours rests with the local authorities. FAA determinations under part 150 are not intended to substitute federally determined land uses for those determined to be appropriate by local authorities in response to locally determined needs and values in achieving noise compatible land uses.

Key to Table 1

SLUCM = Standard Land Use Coding Manual.

Y (Yes) = Land Use and related structures compatible without restrictions.

N (No) = Land Use and related structures are not compatible and should be prohibited.

NLR = Noise Level Reduction (outdoor to indoor) to be achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation into the design and construction of the structure.

25, 30, or 35 = Land use and related structures generally compatible; measures to achieve NLR of 25, 30, or 35 dB must be incorporated into design and construction of structure.

Notes for Table 1

\(1\) Where the community determines that residential or school uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor Noise Level Reduction (NLR) of at least 25 dB and 30 dB should be incorporated into building codes and be considered in individual approvals. Normal residential construction can be expected to provide a NLR of 20 dB, thus, the reduction requirements are often stated as 5, 10 or 15 dB over standard construction and normally assume mechanical ventilation and closed windows year round. However, the use of NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems.

\(2\) Measures to achieve NLR 25 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.

\(3\) Measures to achieve NLR of 30 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.

\(4\) Measures to achieve NLR 35 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal level is low.

\(5\) Land use compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed.

\(6\) Residential buildings require an NLR of 25.

\(7\) Residential buildings require an NLR of 30.

\(8\) Residential buildings not permitted.

### Sec. A150.103   Use of computer prediction model.

\(a\) The airport operator shall acquire the aviation operations data necessary to develop noise exposure contours using an FAA approved methodology or computer program, such as the Integrated Noise Model (INM) for airports or the Heliport Noise Model (HNM) for heliports. In considering approval of a methodology or computer program, key factors include the demonstrated capability to produce the required output and the public availability of the program or methodology to provide interested parties the opportunity to substantiate the results.

\(b\) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following information must be obtained for input to the calculation of noise exposure contours:

\(1\) A map of the airport and its environs at an adequately detailed scale (not less than 1 inch to 2,000 feet) indicating runway length, alignments, landing thresholds, takeoff start-of-roll points, airport boundary, and flight tracks out to at least 30,000 feet from the end of each runway.

\(2\) Airport activity levels and operational data which will indicate, on an annual average-daily-basis, the number of aircraft, by type of aircraft, which utilize each flight track, in both the standard daytime (0700-2200 hours local) and nighttime (2200-0700 hours local) periods for both landings and takeoffs.

\(3\) For landings—glide slopes, glide slope intercept altitudes, and other pertinent information needed to establish approach profiles along with the engine power levels needed to fly that approach profile.

\(4\) For takeoffs—the flight profile which is the relationship of altitude to distance from start-of-roll along with the engine power levels needed to fly that takeoff profile; these data must reflect the use of noise abatement departure procedures and, if applicable, the takeoff weight of the aircraft or some proxy for weight such as stage length.

\(5\) Existing topographical or airspace restrictions which preclude the utilization of alternative flight tracks.

\(6\) The government furnished data depicting aircraft noise characteristics (if not already a part of the computer program's stored data bank).

\(7\) Airport elevation and average temperature.

\(c\) For heliports, the map scale required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not be less than 1 inch to 2,000 feet and shall indicate heliport boundaries, takeoff and landing pads, and typical flight tracks out to at least 4,000 feet horizontally from the landing pad. Where these flight tracks cannot be determined, obstructions or other limitations on flight tracks in and out of the heliport shall be identified within the map areas out to at least 4,000 feet horizontally from the landing pad. For static operation (hover), the helicopter type, the number of daily operations based on an annual average, and the duration in minutes of the hover operation shall be identified. The other information required in paragraph (b) shall be furnished in a form suitable for input to the HNM or other FAA approved methodology or computer program.

### Sec. A150.105   Identification of public agencies and planning agencies.

\(a\) The airport proprietor shall identify each public agency and planning agency whose jurisdiction or responsibility is either wholly or partially within the Ldn 65 dB boundary.

\(b\) For those agencies identified in (a) that have land use planning and control authority, the supporting documentation shall identify their geographic areas of jurisdiction.

### Appendix B to Part 150—Noise Compatibility Programs

Sec. B150.1   Scope and purpose.

Sec. B150.3   Requirement for noise map.

Sec. B150.5   Program standards.

Sec. B150.7   Analysis of program alternatives.

Sec. B150.9   Equivalent programs.

### Sec. B150.1   Scope and purpose.

\(a\) This appendix prescribes the content and the methods for developing noise compatibility programs authorized under this part. Each program must set forth the measures which the airport operator (or other person or agency responsible) has taken, or proposes to take, for the reduction of existing noncompatible land uses and the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure map submitted by the operator.

\(b\) The purpose of a noise compatibility program is:

\(1\) To promote a planning process through which the airport operator can examine and analyze the noise impact created by the operation of an airport, as well as the costs and benefits associated with various alternative noise reduction techniques, and the responsible impacted land use control jurisdictions can examine existing and forecast areas of noncompatibility and consider actions to reduce noncompatible uses.

\(2\) To bring together through public participation, agency coordination, and overall cooperation, all interested parties with their respective authorities and obligations, thereby facilitating the creation of an agreed upon noise abatement plan especially suited to the individual airport location while at the same time not unduly affecting the national air transportation system.

\(3\) To develop comprehensive and implementable noise reduction techniques and land use controls which, to the maximum extent feasible, will confine severe aircraft YDNL values of Ldn 75 dB or greater to areas included within the airport boundary and will establish and maintain compatible land uses in the areas affected by noise between the Ldn 65 and 75 dB contours.

### Sec. B150.3   Requirement for noise map.

\(a\) It is required that a current and complete noise exposure map and its supporting documentation as found in compliance with the applicable requirements by the FAA, per [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.21   Noise exposure maps and related descriptions.\|§150.21]](c) be included in each noise compatibility program:

\(1\) To identify existing and future noncompatible land uses, based on airport operation and off-airport land uses, which have generated the need to develop a program.

\(2\) To identify changes in noncompatible uses to be derived from proposed program measures.

\(b\) If the proposed noise compatibility program would yield maps differing from those previously submitted to FAA, the program shall be accompanied by appropriately revised maps. Such revisions must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec. A150.101(e) of appendix A and will be accepted by FAA in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.35   Determinations; publications; effectivity.\|§150.35]](f).

### Sec. B150.5   Program standards.

Based upon the airport noise exposure and noncompatible land uses identified in the map, the airport operator shall evaluate the several alternative noise control actions and develop a noise compatibility program which—

\(a\) Reduces existing noncompatible uses and prevents or reduces the probability of the establishment of additional noncompatible uses;

\(b\) Does not impose undue burden on interstate and foreign commerce;

\(c\) Provides for revision in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.23   Noise compatibility programs.\|§150.23]] of this part.

\(d\) Is not unjustly discriminatory.

\(e\) Does not derogate safety or adversely affect the safe and efficient use of airspace.

\(f\) To the extent practicable, meets both local needs and needs of the national air transportation system, considering tradeoffs between economic benefits derived from the airport and the noise impact.

\(g\) Can be implemented in a manner consistent with all of the powers and duties of the Administrator of FAA.

### Sec. B150.7   Analysis of program alternatives.

\(a\) Noise control alternatives must be considered and presented according to the following categories:

\(1\) Noise abatement alternatives for which the airport operator has adequate implementation authority.

\(2\) Noise abatement alternatives for which the requisite implementation authority is vested in a local agency or political subdivision governing body, or a state agency or political subdivision governing body.

\(3\) Noise abatement options for which requisite authority is vested in the FAA or other Federal agency.

\(b\) At a minimum, the operator shall analyze and report on the following alternatives, subject to the constraints that the strategies are appropriate to the specific airport (for example, an evaluation of night curfews is not appropriate if there are no night flights and none are forecast):

\(1\) Acquisition of land and interests therein, including, but not limited to air rights, easements, and development rights, to ensure the use of property for purposes which are compatible with airport operations.

\(2\) The construction of barriers and acoustical shielding, including the soundproofing of public buildings.

\(3\) The implementation of a preferential runway system.

\(4\) The use of flight procedures (including the modifications of flight tracks) to control the operation of aircraft to reduce exposure of individuals (or specific noise sensitive areas) to noise in the area around the airport.

\(5\) The implementation of any restriction on the use of airport by any type or class of aircraft based on the noise characteristics of those aircraft. Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to—

\(i\) Denial of use of the airport to aircraft types or classes which do not meet Federal noise standards;

\(ii\) Capacity limitations based on the relative noisiness of different types of aircraft;

\(iii\) Requirement that aircraft using the airport must use noise abatement takeoff or approach procedures previously approved as safe by the FAA;

\(iv\) Landing fees based on FAA certificated or estimated noise emission levels or on time of arrival; and

\(v\) Partial or complete curfews.

\(6\) Other actions or combinations of actions which would have a beneficial noise control or abatement impact on the public.

\(7\) Other actions recommended for analysis by the FAA for the specific airport.

\(c\) For those alternatives selected for implementation, the program must identify the agency or agencies responsible for such implementation, whether those agencies have agreed to the implementation, and the approximate schedule agreed upon.

### Sec. B150.9   Equivalent programs.

\(a\) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, noise compatibility programs prepared in connection with studies which were either Federally funded or Federally approved and commenced before October 1, 1981, are not required to be modified to contain the following items:

\(1\) Flight tracks.

\(2\) A noise contour of Ldn 70 dB resulting from aircraft operations and data related to the Ldn 70 dB contour. When determinations on land use compatibility using Table 1 of appendix A differ between Ldn 65-70 dB and Ldn 70-75 dB, the determinations should either use the more conservative Ldn 70-75 dB column or reflect determinations based on local needs and values.

\(3\) The categorization of alternatives pursuant to Sec. B150.7(a), although the persons responsible for implementation of each measure in the program must still be identified in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning#§150.23   Noise compatibility programs.\|§150.23]](e)(8).

\(4\) Use of ambient noise to determine land use compatibility.

\(b\) Previously prepared noise compatibility program documentation may be supplemented to include these and other program requirements which have not been excepted.

\(a\) Notice requirements and procedures for airport operators implementing Stage 3 aircraft noise and access restrictions pursuant to agreements between airport operators and aircraft operators;

\(b\) Analysis and notice requirements for airport operators proposing Stage 2 aircraft noise and access restrictions;

\(c\) Notice, review, and approval requirements for airport operators proposing Stage 3 aircraft noise and access restrictions; and

\(d\) Procedures for Federal Aviation Administration reevaluation of agreements containing restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft operations and of aircraft noise and access restrictions affecting Stage 3 aircraft operations imposed by airport operators.

### §161.3   Applicability.

\(a\) This part applies to airports imposing restrictions on Stage 2 aircraft operations proposed after October 1, 1990, and to airports imposing restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft operations that became effective after October 1, 1990.

\(b\) This part also applies to airports enacting amendments to airport noise and access restrictions in effect on October 1, 1990, but amended after that date, where the amendment reduces or limits aircraft operations or affects aircraft safety.

\(c\) The notice, review, and approval requirements set forth in this part apply to all airports imposing noise or access restrictions as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.5   Definitions.\|§161.5]] of this part.

### §161.5   Definitions.

For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:

*Agreement* means a document in writing signed by the airport operator; those aircraft operators currently operating at the airport that would be affected by the noise or access restriction; and all affected new entrants planning to provide new air service within 180 days of the effective date of the restriction that have submitted to the airport operator a plan of operations and notice of agreement to the restriction.

*Aircraft operator,* for purposes of this part, means any owner of an aircraft that operates the aircraft, i.e., uses, causes to use, or authorizes the use of the aircraft; or in the case of a leased aircraft, any lessee that operates the aircraft pursuant to a lease. As used in this part, aircraft operator also means any representative of the aircraft owner, or in the case of a leased aircraft, any representative of the lessee empowered to enter into agreements with the airport operator regarding use of the airport by an aircraft.

*Airport* means any area of land or water, including any heliport, that is used or intended to be used for the landing and takeoff of aircraft, and any appurtenant areas that are used or intended to be used for airport buildings or other airport facilities or rights-of-way, together with all airport buildings and facilities located thereon.

*Airport noise study area* means that area surrounding the airport within the noise contour selected by the applicant for study and must include the noise contours required to be developed for noise exposure maps specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]].

*Airport operator* means the airport proprietor.

*Aviation user class* means the following categories of aircraft operators: air carriers operating under parts 121 or 129 of this chapter; commuters and other carriers operating under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft\|part 135 of this chapter]]; general aviation, military, or government operations.

*Day-night average sound level (DNL)* means the 24-hour average sound level, in decibels, for the period from midnight to midnight, obtained after the addition of ten decibels to sound levels for the periods between midnight and 7 a.m., and between 10 p.m. and midnight, local time, as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]]. (The scientific notation for DNL is Ldn).

*Noise or access restrictions* means restrictions (including but not limited to provisions of ordinances and leases) affecting access or noise that affect the operations of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft, such as limits on the noise generated on either a single-event or cumulative basis; a limit, direct or indirect, on the total number of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations; a noise budget or noise allocation program that includes Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft; a restriction imposing limits on hours of operations; a program of airport-use charges that has the direct or indirect effect of controlling airport noise; and any other limit on Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft that has the effect of controlling airport noise. This definition does not include peak-period pricing programs where the objective is to align the number of aircraft operations with airport capacity.

*Stage 2 aircraft* means an aircraft that has been shown to comply with the Stage 2 requirements under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0036 Noise standards  aircraft type and airworthiness certification\|14 CFR part 36]].

### §161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.

Each applicant proposing a noise or access restriction on Stage 3 operations shall prepare and make available for public comment an analysis that supports, by substantial evidence, that the six statutory conditions for approval have been met for each restriction and any alternatives submitted. The statutory conditions are set forth in 49 U.S.C. App. 2153(d)(2) and paragraph (e) of this section. Any proposed restriction (including alternatives) on Stage 3 aircraft operations that also affects the operation of Stage 2 aircraft must include analysis of the proposals in a manner that permits the proposal to be understood in its entirety. (Nothing in this section is intended to add a requirement for the issuance of restrictions on Stage 2 aircraft to those of subpart C of this part.) The applicant shall provide:

\(a\) The complete text of the proposed restriction and any submitted alternatives, including the proposed wording in a city ordinance, airport rule, lease, or other document, and any sanctions for noncompliance;

\(b\) Maps denoting the airport geographic boundary, and the geographic boundaries and names of each jurisdiction that controls land use within the airport noise study area;

\(c\) An adequate environmental assessment of the proposed restriction or adequate information supporting a categorical exclusion in accordance with FAA orders and procedures regarding compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321);

\(d\) A summary of the evidence in the submission supporting the six statutory conditions for approval; and

\(e\) An analysis of the restriction, demonstrating by substantial evidence that the statutory conditions are met. The analysis must:

\(1\) Be sufficiently detailed to allow the FAA to evaluate the merits of the proposed restriction; and

\(2\) Contain the following essential elements needed to provide substantial evidence supporting each condition for approval:

\(i\) *Condition 1: The restriction is reasonable, nonarbitrary, and nondiscriminatory.* (A) Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes the following:

(*1*) Evidence that a current or projected noise or access problem exists, and that the proposed action(s) could relieve the problem, including:

(*i*) A detailed description of the problem precipitating the proposed restriction with relevant background information on factors contributing to the proposal and any court-ordered action or estimated liability concerns; a description of any noise agreements or noise or access restrictions currently in effect at the airport; and measures taken to achieve land-use compatibility, such as controls or restrictions on land use in the vicinity of the airport and measures carried out in response to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]]; and actions taken to comply with grant assurances requiring that:

(*A*) Airport development projects be reasonably consistent with plans of public agencies that are authorized to plan for the development of the area around the airport; and

(*B*) The sponsor give fair consideration to the interests of communities in or near where the project may be located; take appropriate action, including the adoption of zoning laws, to the extent reasonable, to restrict the use of land near the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations; and not cause or permit any change in land use, within its jurisdiction, that will reduce the compatibility (with respect to the airport) of any noise compatibility program measures upon which federal funds have been expended.

(*ii*) An analysis of the estimated noise impact of aircraft operations with and without the proposed restriction for the year the restriction is expected to be implemented, for a forecast timeframe after implementation, and for any other years critical to understanding the noise impact of the proposed restriction. The analysis of noise impact with and without the proposed restriction including:

(*A*) Maps of the airport noise study area overlaid with noise contours as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.9   Designation of noise description methods.\|§§161.9]] and 161.11 of this part;

(*B*) The number of people and the noncompatible land uses within the airport noise study area with and without the proposed restriction for each year the noise restriction is analyzed;

(*C*) Technical data supporting the noise impact analysis, including the classes of aircraft, fleet mix, runway use percentage, and day/night breakout of operations; and

(*D*) Data on current and projected airport activity that would exist in the absence of the proposed restriction.

(*2*) Evidence that other available remedies are infeasible or would be less cost-effective, including descriptions of any alternative aircraft restrictions that have been considered and rejected, and the reasons for the rejection; and of any land use or other nonaircraft controls or restrictions that have been considered and rejected, including those proposed under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] and not implemented, and the reasons for the rejection or failure to implement.

(*3*) Evidence that the noise or access standards are the same for all aviation user classes or that the differences are justified, such as:

(*i*) A description of the relationship of the effect of the proposed restriction on airport users (by aviation user class); and

(*ii*) The noise attributable to these users in the absence of the proposed restriction.

\(B\) At the applicant's discretion, information may also be submitted as follows:

(*1*) Evidence not submitted under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (Condition 2) that there is a reasonable chance that expected benefits will equal or exceed expected cost; for example, comparative economic analyses of the costs and benefits of the proposed restriction and aircraft and nonaircraft alternative measures. For detailed elements of analysis, see paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

(*2*) Evidence not submitted under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that the level of any noise-based fees that may be imposed reflects the cost of mitigating noise impacts produced by the aircraft, or that the fees are reasonably related to the intended level of noise impact mitigation.

\(ii\) *Condition 2: The restriction does not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce.* (A) Essential information needed to demonstrate this statutory condition includes:

(*1*) Evidence, based on a cost-benefit analysis, that the estimated potential benefits of the restriction have a reasonable chance to exceed the estimated potential cost of the adverse effects on interstate and foreign commerce. In preparing the economic analysis required by this section, the applicant shall use currently accepted economic methodology, specify the methods used and assumptions underlying the analysis, and consider:

(*i*) The effect of the proposed restriction on operations of aircraft by aviation user class (and for air carriers, the number of operations of aircraft by carrier), and on the volume of passengers and cargo for the year the restriction is expected to be implemented and for the forecast timeframe.

(*ii*) The estimated costs of the proposed restriction and alternative nonaircraft restrictions including the following, as appropriate:

(*A*) Any additional cost of continuing aircraft operations under the restriction, including reasonably available information concerning any net capital costs of acquiring or retrofitting aircraft (net of salvage value and operating efficiencies) by aviation user class; and any incremental recurring costs;

(*B*) Costs associated with altered or discontinued aircraft operations, such as reasonably available information concerning loss to carriers of operating profits; decreases in passenger and shipper consumer surplus by aviation user class; loss in profits associated with other airport services or other entities: and/or any significant economic effect on parties other than aviation users.

(*C*) Costs associated with implementing nonaircraft restrictions or nonaircraft components of restrictions, such as reasonably available information concerning estimates of capital costs for real property, including redevelopment, soundproofing, noise easements, and purchase of property interests; and estimates of associated incremental recurring costs; or an explanation of the legal or other impediments to implementing such restrictions.

(*D*) Estimated benefits of the proposed restriction and alternative restrictions that consider, as appropriate, anticipated increase in real estate values and future construction cost (such as sound insulation) savings; anticipated increase in airport revenues; quantification of the noise benefits, such as number of people removed from noise contours and improved work force and/or educational productivity, if any; valuation of positive safety effects, if any; and/or other qualitative benefits, including improvements in quality of life.

\(B\) At the applicant's discretion, information may also be submitted as follows:

(*1*) Evidence that the affected carriers have a reasonable chance to continue service at the airport or at other points in the national airport system.

(*2*) Evidence that other air carriers are able to provide adequate service to the airport and other points in the system without diminishing competition.

(*3*) Evidence that comparable services or facilities are available at another airport controlled by the airport operator in the market area, including services available at other airports.

(*4*) Evidence that alternative transportation service can be attained through other means of transportation.

(*5*) Information on the absence of adverse evidence or adverse comments with respect to undue burden in the notice process required in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]], or alternatively in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.321 Optional use of 0150 Airport noise compatibility planning 14 CFR part 150 procedures.\|§161.321]], of this part as evidence that there is no undue burden.

\(iii\) *Condition 3: The proposed restriction maintains safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace.* Essential information needed to demonstrate this statutory condition includes evidence that the proposed restriction maintains safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace based upon:

\(A\) Identification of airspace and obstacles to navigation in the vicinity of the airport; and

\(B\) An analysis of the effects of the proposed restriction with respect to use of airspace in the vicinity of the airport, substantiating that the restriction maintains or enhances safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. The analysis shall include a description of the methods and data used.

\(iv\) *Condition 4: The proposed restriction does not conflict with any existing Federal statute or regulation.* Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes evidence demonstrating that no conflict is presented between the proposed restriction and any existing Federal statute or regulation, including those governing:

\(A\) Exclusive rights;

\(B\) Control of aircraft operations; and

\(C\) Existing Federal grant agreements.

\(v\) *Condition 5: The applicant has provided adequate opportunity for public comment on the proposed restriction.* Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes evidence that there has been adequate opportunity for public comment on the restriction as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]] or [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.321 Optional use of 0150 Airport noise compatibility planning 14 CFR part 150 procedures.\|§161.321]] of this part.

\(vi\) *Condition 6: The proposed restriction does not create an undue burden on the national aviation system.* Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes evidence that the proposed restriction does not create an undue burden on the national aviation system such as:

\(A\) An analysis demonstrating that the proposed restriction does not have a substantial adverse effect on existing or planned airport system capacity, on observed or forecast airport system congestion and aircraft delay, and on airspace system capacity or workload;

\(B\) An analysis demonstrating that nonaircraft alternative measures to achieve the same goals as the proposed subject restrictions are inappropriate;

\(C\) The absence of comments with respect to imposition of an undue burden on the national aviation system in response to the notice required in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]] or [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.321 Optional use of 0150 Airport noise compatibility planning 14 CFR part 150 procedures.\|§161.321]].

### §161.307   Comment by interested parties.

\(a\) Each applicant proposing a restriction shall establish a public docket or similar method for receiving and considering comments, and shall make comments available for inspection by interested parties upon request. Comments must be retained as long as the restriction is in effect.

\(b\) Each applicant shall submit to the FAA a summary of any comments received. Upon request by the FAA, the applicant shall submit copies of the comments.

### §161.309   Requirements for proposal changes.

\(a\) Each applicant shall promptly advise interested parties of any changes to a proposed restriction or alternative restriction that are not encompassed in the proposals submitted, including changes that affect noncompatible land uses or that take place before the effective date of the restriction, and make available these changes to the proposed restriction and its analysis. For the purpose of this paragraph, interested parties include those who received direct notice under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]](b) of this part, or those who were required to be consulted in accordance with the procedures in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.321 Optional use of 0150 Airport noise compatibility planning 14 CFR part 150 procedures.\|§161.321]] of this part, and those who commented on the proposed restriction.

\(b\) If there are substantial changes to a proposed restriction or the analysis made available prior to the effective date of the restriction, the applicant proposing the restriction shall initiate new notice in accordance with the procedures in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]] or, alternatively, the procedures in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.321 Optional use of 0150 Airport noise compatibility planning 14 CFR part 150 procedures.\|§161.321]]. These requirements apply to substantial changes that are not encompassed in submitted alternative restriction proposals and their analyses. A substantial change to a restriction includes, but is not limited to, any proposal that would increase the burden on any aviation user class.

\(c\) In addition to the information in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]](c), a new notice must indicate that the applicant is revising a previous notice, provide the reason for making the revision, and provide a new effective date (if any) for the restriction.

\(d\) If substantial changes requiring a new notice are made during the FAA's 180-day review of the proposed restriction, the applicant submitting the proposed restriction shall notify the FAA in writing that it is withdrawing its proposal from the review process until it has completed additional analysis, public review, and documentation of the public review. Resubmission to the FAA will restart the 180-day review.

### §161.311   Application procedure for approval of proposed restriction.

Each applicant proposing a Stage 3 restriction shall submit to the FAA the following information for each restriction and alternative restriction submitted, with a request that the FAA review and approve the proposed Stage 3 noise or access restriction:

\(a\) A summary of evidence of the fulfillment of conditions for approval, as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]];

\(b\) An analysis as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]], as appropriate to the proposed restriction;

\(c\) A statement that the entity submitting the proposal is the party empowered to implement the restriction, or is submitting the proposal on behalf of such party; and

\(d\) A statement as to whether the airport requests, in the event of disapproval of the proposed restriction or any alternatives, that the FAA approve any portion of the restriction or any alternative that meets the statutory requirements for approval. An applicant requesting partial approval of any proposal should indicate its priorities as to portions of the proposal to be approved.

### §161.313   Review of application.

\(a\) *Determination of completeness.* The FAA, within 30 days of receipt of an application, will determine whether the application is complete in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.311   Application procedure for approval of proposed restriction.\|§161.311]]. Determinations of completeness will be made on all proposed restrictions and alternatives. This completeness determination is not an approval or disapproval of the proposed restriction.

\(b\) *Process for complete application.* When the FAA determines that a complete application has been submitted, the following procedures apply:

\(1\) The FAA notifies the applicant that it intends to act on the proposed restriction and publishes notice of the proposed restriction in the Federal Register in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.315   Receipt of complete application.\|§161.315]]. The 180-day period for approving or disapproving the proposed restriction will start on the date of original FAA receipt of the application.

\(2\) Following review of the application, public comments, and any other information obtained under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.317   Approval or disapproval of proposed restriction.\|§161.317]](b), the FAA will issue a decision approving or disapproving the proposed restriction. This decision is a final decision of the Administrator for purpose of judicial review.

\(c\) *Process for incomplete application.* If the FAA determines that an application is not complete with respect to any submitted restriction or alternative restriction, the following procedures apply:

\(1\) The FAA shall notify the applicant in writing, returning the application and setting forth the type of information and analysis needed to complete the application in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.311   Application procedure for approval of proposed restriction.\|§161.311]].

\(2\) Within 30 days after the receipt of this notice, the applicant shall advise the FAA in writing whether or not it intends to resubmit and supplement its application.

\(3\) If the applicant does not respond in 30 days, or advises the FAA that it does not intend to resubmit and/or supplement the application, the application will be denied. This closes the matter without prejudice to later application and does not constitute disapproval of the proposed restriction.

\(4\) If the applicant chooses to resubmit and supplement the application, the following procedures apply:

\(i\) Upon receipt of the resubmitted application, the FAA determines whether the application, as supplemented, is complete as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

\(ii\) If the application is complete, the procedures set forth in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.315   Receipt of complete application.\|§161.315]] shall be followed. The 180-day review period starts on the date of receipt of the last supplement to the application.

\(iii\) If the application is still not complete with respect to the proposed restriction or at least one submitted alternative, the FAA so advises the applicant as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and provides the applicant with an additional opportunity to supplement the application as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

\(iv\) If the environmental documentation (either an environmental assessment or information supporting a categorical exclusion) is incomplete, the FAA will so notify the applicant in writing, returning the application and setting forth the types of information and analysis needed to complete the documentation. The FAA will continue to return an application until adequate environmental documentation is provided. When the application is determined to be complete, including the environmental documentation, the 180-day period for approval or disapproval will begin upon receipt of the last supplement to the application.

\(v\) Following review of the application and its supplements, public comments, and any other information obtained under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.317   Approval or disapproval of proposed restriction.\|§161.317]](b), the FAA will issue a decision approving or disapproving the application. This decision is a final decision of the Administrator for the purpose of judicial review.

\(5\) The FAA will deny the application and return it to the applicant if:

\(i\) None of the proposals submitted are found to be complete;

\(ii\) The application has been returned twice to the applicant for reasons other than completion of the environmental documentation; and

\(iii\) The applicant declines to complete the application. This closes the matter without prejudice to later application, and does not constitute disapproval of the proposed restriction.

### §161.315   Receipt of complete application.

\(a\) When a complete application has been received, the FAA will notify the applicant by letter that the FAA intends to act on the application.

\(b\) The FAA will publish notice of the proposed restriction in the Federal Register, inviting interested parties to file comments on the application within 30 days after publication of the Federal Register notice.

### §161.317   Approval or disapproval of proposed restriction.

\(a\) Upon determination that an application is complete with respect to at least one of the proposals submitted by the applicant, the FAA will act upon the complete proposals in the application. The FAA will not act on any proposal for which the applicant has declined to submit additional necessary information.

\(b\) The FAA will review the applicant's proposals in the preference order specified by the applicant. The FAA may request additional information from aircraft operators, or any other party, and may convene an informal meeting to gather facts relevant to its determination.

\(c\) The FAA will evaluate the proposal and issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed restriction and any submitted alternatives, in whole or in part, in the order of preference indicated by the applicant. Once the FAA approves a proposed restriction, the FAA will not consider any proposals of lower applicant-stated preference. Approval or disapproval will be given by the FAA within 180 days after receipt of the application or last supplement thereto under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.313   Review of application.\|§161.313]]. The FAA will publish its decision in the Federal Register and notify the applicant in writing.

\(d\) The applicant's failure to provide substantial evidence supporting the statutory conditions for approval of a particular proposal is grounds for disapproval of that proposed restriction.

\(e\) The FAA will approve or disapprove only the Stage 3 aspects of a restriction if the restriction applies to both Stage 2 and Stage 3 aircraft operations.

\(f\) An order approving a restriction may be subject to requirements that the applicant:

\(1\) Comply with factual representations and commitments in support of the restriction; and

\(2\) Ensure that any environmental mitigation actions or commitments by any party that are set forth in the environmental documentation provided in support of the restriction are implemented.

### §161.319   Withdrawal or revision of restriction.

\(a\) The applicant may withdraw or revise a proposed restriction at any time prior to FAA approval or disapproval, and must do so if substantial changes are made as described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.309   Requirements for proposal changes.\|§161.309]]. The applicant shall notify the FAA in writing of a decision to withdraw the proposed restriction for any reason. The FAA will publish a notice in the Federal Register that it has terminated its review without prejudice to resubmission. A resubmission will be considered a new application.

\(b\) A subsequent amendment to a Stage 3 restriction that was in effect after October 1, 1990, or an amendment to a Stage 3 restriction previously approved by the FAA, is subject to the procedures in this subpart if the amendment will further reduce or limit aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety. The applicant may, at its option, revise or amend a restriction previously disapproved by the FAA and resubmit it for approval. Amendments are subject to the same requirements and procedures as initial submissions.

### §161.321   Optional use of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] procedures.

\(a\) An airport operator may use the procedures in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|part 150 of this chapter]], instead of the procedures described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§§161.303]](b) and 161.309(b) of this part, as a means of providing an adequate public notice and opportunity to comment on proposed Stage 3 restrictions, including submitted alternatives.

\(b\) If the airport operator elects to use [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] procedures to comply with this subpart, the operator shall:

\(1\) Ensure that all parties identified for direct notice under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]](b) are notified that the airport's [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] program submission will include a proposed Stage 3 restriction under part 161, and that these parties are offered the opportunity to participate as consulted parties during the development of the [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] program;

\(2\) Include the information required in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.303   Notice of proposed restrictions.\|§161.303]](c) (2) through (5) and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]] in the analysis of the proposed restriction in the [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] program submission; and

\(3\) Include in its [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] submission to the FAA evidence of compliance with the notice requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and include the information required for a part 161 application in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.311   Application procedure for approval of proposed restriction.\|§161.311]], together with a clear identification that the [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] submission includes a proposed Stage 3 restriction for FAA review and approval under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.313   Review of application.\|§§161.313]], 161.315, and 161.317.

\(c\) The FAA will evaluate the proposed part 161 restriction on Stage 3 aircraft operations included in the [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] submission in accordance with the procedures and standards of this part, and will review the total [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] submission in accordance with the procedures and standards of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]].

\(d\) An amendment of a restriction, as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.319   Withdrawal or revision of restriction.\|§161.319]](b) of this part, may also be processed under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0150 Airport noise compatibility planning\|14 CFR part 150]] procedures.

### §161.323   Notification of a decision not to implement a restriction.

If a Stage 3 restriction has been approved by the FAA and the restriction is not subsequently implemented, the applicant shall so advise the interested parties specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.309   Requirements for proposal changes.\|§161.309]](a) of this part.

### §161.325   Availability of data and comments on an implemented restriction.

The applicant shall retain all relevant supporting data and all comments relating to an approved restriction for as long as the restriction is in effect and shall make these materials available for inspection upon request by the FAA. This information shall be made available for inspection by any person during the pendency of any petition for reevaluation found justified by the FAA.

## Subpart E—Reevaluation of Stage 3 Restrictions

### §161.401   Scope.

This subpart applies to an airport imposing a noise or access restriction on the operation of Stage 3 aircraft that first became effective after October 1, 1990, and had either been agreed to in compliance with the procedures in subpart B of this part or approved by the FAA in accordance with the procedures in subpart D of this part. This subpart does not apply to Stage 2 restrictions imposed by airports. This subpart does not apply to Stage 3 restrictions specifically exempted in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.7   Limitations.\|§161.7]].

### §161.403   Criteria for reevaluation.

\(a\) A request for reevaluation must be submitted by an aircraft operator.

\(b\) An aircraft operator must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FAA that there has been a change in the noise environment of the affected airport and that a review and reevaluation pursuant to the criteria in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]] is therefore justified.

\(1\) A change in the noise environment sufficient to justify reevaluation is either a DNL change of 1.5 dB or greater (from the restriction's anticipated target noise level result) over noncompatible land uses, or a change of 17 percent or greater in the noncompatible land uses, within an airport noise study area. For approved restrictions, calculation of change shall be based on the divergence of actual noise impact of the restriction from the estimated noise impact of the restriction predicted in the analysis required in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]](e)(2)(i)(A)(*1*)(*ii*). The change in the noise environment or in the noncompatible land uses may be either an increase or decrease in noise or in noncompatible land uses. An aircraft operator may submit to the FAA reasons why a change that does not fall within either of these parameters justifies reevaluation, and the FAA will consider such arguments on a case-by-case basis.

\(2\) A change in the noise environment justifies reevaluation if the change is likely to result in the restriction not meeting one or more of the conditions for approval set forth in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]] of this part for approval. The aircraft operator must demonstrate that such a result is likely to occur.

\(c\) A reevaluation may not occur less than 2 years after the date of the FAA approval. The FAA will normally apply the same 2-year requirement to agreements under subpart B of this part that affect Stage 3 aircraft operations. An aircraft operator may submit to the FAA reasons why an agreement under subpart B of this part should be reevaluated in less than 2 years, and the FAA will consider such arguments on a case-by-case basis.

\(d\) An aircraft operator must demonstrate that it has made a good faith attempt to resolve locally any dispute over a restriction with the affected parties, including the airport operator, before requesting reevaluation by the FAA. Such demonstration and certification shall document all attempts of local dispute resolution.

### §161.405   Request for reevaluation.

\(a\) A request for reevaluation submitted to the FAA by an aircraft operator must include the following information:

\(1\) The name of the airport and associated cities and states;

\(2\) A clear, concise description of the restriction and any sanctions for noncompliance, whether the restriction was approved by the FAA or agreed to by the airport operator and aircraft operators, the date of the approval or agreement, and a copy of the restriction as incorporated in a local ordinance, airport rule, lease, or other document;

\(3\) The quantified change in the noise environment using methodology specified in this part;

\(4\) Evidence of the relationship between this change and the likelihood that the restriction does not meet one or more of the conditions in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]];

\(5\) The aircraft operator's status under the restriction (e.g., currently affected operator, potential new entrant) and an explanation of the aircraft operator's specific objection; and

\(6\) A description and evidence of the aircraft operator's attempt to resolve the dispute locally with the affected parties, including the airport operator.

\(b\) The FAA will evaluate the aircraft operator's submission and determine whether or not a reevaluation is justified. The FAA may request additional information from the airport operator or any other party and may convene an informal meeting to gather facts relevant to its determination.

\(c\) The FAA will notify the aircraft operator in writing, with a copy to the affected airport operator, of its determination.

\(1\) If the FAA determines that a reevaluation is not justified, it will indicate the reasons for this decision.

\(2\) If the FAA determines that a reevaluation is justified, the aircraft operator will be notified to complete its analysis and to begin the public notice procedure, as set forth in this subpart.

### §161.407   Notice of reevaluation.

\(a\) After receiving an FAA determination that a reevaluation is justified, an aircraft operator desiring continuation of the reevaluation process shall publish a notice of request for reevaluation in an areawide newspaper or newspapers that either singly or together has general circulation throughout the airport noise study area (or the airport vicinity for agreements where an airport noise study area has not been delineated); post a notice in the airport in a prominent location accessible to airport users and the public; and directly notify in writing the following parties:

\(1\) The airport operator, other aircraft operators providing scheduled passenger or cargo service at the airport, operators of aircraft based at the airport, potential new entrants that are known to be interested in serving the airport, and aircraft operators known to be routinely providing nonscheduled service;

\(2\) The Federal Aviation Administration;

\(3\) Each Federal, State, and local agency with land-use control jurisdiction within the airport noise study area (or the airport vicinity for agreements where an airport noise study area has not been delineated);

\(4\) Fixed-base operators and other airport tenants whose operations may be affected by the agreement or the restriction;

\(5\) Community groups and business organizations that are known to be interested in the restriction; and

\(6\) Any other party that commented on the original restriction.

\(b\) Each notice provided in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall include:

\(1\) The name of the airport and associated cities and states;

\(2\) A clear, concise description of the restriction, including whether the restriction was approved by the FAA or agreed to by the airport operator and aircraft operators, and the date of the approval or agreement;

\(3\) The name of the aircraft operator requesting a reevaluation, and a statement that a reevaluation has been requested and that the FAA has determined that a reevaluation is justified;

\(4\) A brief discussion of the reasons why a reevaluation is justified;

\(5\) An analysis prepared in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.409   Required analysis by reevaluation petitioner.\|§161.409]] of this part supporting the aircraft operator's reevaluation request, or an announcement of where the analysis is available for public inspection;

\(6\) An invitation to comment on the analysis supporting the proposed reevaluation, with a minimum 45-day comment period;

\(7\) Information on how to request a copy of the analysis (if not in the notice); and

\(8\) The address for submitting comments to the aircraft operator, including identification of a contact person.

### §161.409   Required analysis by reevaluation petitioner.

\(a\) An aircraft operator that has petitioned the FAA to reevaluate a restriction shall assume the burden of analysis for the reevaluation.

\(b\) The aircraft operator's analysis shall be made available for public review under the procedures in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.407   Notice of reevaluation.\|§161.407]] and shall include the following:

\(1\) A copy of the restriction or the language of the agreement as incorporated in a local ordinance, airport rule, lease, or other document;

\(2\) The aircraft operator's status under the restriction (e.g., currently affected operator, potential new entrant) and an explanation of the aircraft operator's specific objection to the restriction;

\(3\) The quantified change in the noise environment using methodology specified in this part;

\(4\) Evidence of the relationship between this change and the likelihood that the restriction does not meet one or more of the conditions in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]]; and

\(5\) Sufficient data and analysis selected from [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]], as applicable to the restriction at issue, to support the contention made in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. This is to include either an adequate environmental assessment of the impacts of discontinuing all or part of a restriction in accordance with the aircraft operator's petition, or adequate information supporting a categorical exclusion under FAA orders implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321).

\(c\) The amount of analysis may vary with the complexity of the restriction, the number and nature of the conditions in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]] that are alleged to be unsupported, and the amount of previous analysis developed in support of the restriction. The aircraft operator may incorporate analysis previously developed in support of the restriction, including previous environmental documentation to the extent applicable. The applicant is responsible for providing substantial evidence, as described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]], that one or more of the conditions are not supported.

### §161.411   Comment by interested parties.

\(a\) Each aircraft operator requesting a reevaluation shall establish a docket or similar method for receiving and considering comments and shall make comments available for inspection to interested parties specified in paragraph (b) of this section upon request. Comments must be retained for two years.

\(b\) Each aircraft operator shall promptly notify interested parties if it makes a substantial change in its analysis that affects either the costs or benefits analyzed, or the criteria in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]], differently from the analysis made available for comment in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.407   Notice of reevaluation.\|§161.407]]. Interested parties include those who received direct notice under paragraph (a) of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.407   Notice of reevaluation.\|§161.407]] and those who have commented on the reevaluation. If an aircraft operator revises its analysis, it shall make the revised analysis available to an interested party upon request and shall extend the comment period at least 45 days from the date the revised analysis is made available.

### §161.413   Reevaluation procedure.

\(a\) Each aircraft operator requesting a reevaluation shall submit to the FAA:

\(1\) The analysis described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.409   Required analysis by reevaluation petitioner.\|§161.409]];

\(2\) Evidence that the public review process was carried out in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.407   Notice of reevaluation.\|§§161.407]] and 161.411, including the aircraft operator's summary of the comments received; and

\(3\) A request that the FAA complete a reevaluation of the restriction and issue findings.

\(b\) Following confirmation by the FAA that the aircraft operator's documentation is complete according to the requirements of this subpart, the FAA will publish a notice of reevaluation in the Federal Register and provide for a 45-day comment period during which interested parties may submit comments to the FAA. The FAA will specifically solicit comments from the affected airport operator and affected local governments. A submission that is not complete will be returned to the aircraft operator with a letter indicating the deficiency, and no notice will be published. No further action will be taken by the FAA until a complete submission is received.

\(c\) The FAA will review all submitted documentation and comments pursuant to the conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]]. To the extent necessary, the FAA may request additional information from the aircraft operator, airport operator, and others known to have information material to the reevaluation, and may convene an informal meeting to gather facts relevant to a reevaluation finding.

### §161.415   Reevaluation action.

\(a\) Upon completing the reevaluation, the FAA will issue appropriate orders regarding whether or not there is substantial evidence that the restriction meets the criteria in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]] of this part.

\(b\) If the FAA's reevaluation confirms that the restriction meets the criteria, the restriction may remain as previously agreed to or approved. If the FAA's reevaluation concludes that the restriction does not meet the criteria, the FAA will withdraw a previous approval of the restriction issued under subpart D of this part to the extent necessary to bring the restriction into compliance with this part or, with respect to a restriction agreed to under subpart B of this part, the FAA will specify which criteria are not met.

\(c\) The FAA will publish a notice of its reevaluation findings in the Federal Register and notify in writing the aircraft operator that petitioned the FAA for reevaluation and the affected airport operator.

### §161.417   Notification of status of restrictions and agreements not meeting conditions-of-approval criteria.

If the FAA has withdrawn all or part of a previous approval made under subpart D of this part, the relevant portion of the Stage 3 restriction must be rescinded. The operator of the affected airport shall notify the FAA of the operator's action with regard to a restriction affecting Stage 3 aircraft operations that has been found not to meet the criteria of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.\|§161.305]]. Restrictions in agreements determined by the FAA not to meet conditions for approval may not be enforced with respect to Stage 3 aircraft operations.

## Subpart F—Failure To Comply With This Part

### §161.501   Scope.

\(a\) This subpart describes the procedures to terminate eligibility for airport grant funds and authority to impose or collect passenger facility charges for an airport operator's failure to comply with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (49 U.S.C. App. 2151 *et seq.*) or this part. These procedures may be used with or in addition to any judicial proceedings initiated by the FAA to protect the national aviation system and related Federal interests.

\(b\) Under no conditions shall any airport operator receive revenues under the provisions of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 or impose or collect a passenger facility charge under section 1113(e) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 if the FAA determines that the airport is imposing any noise or access restriction not in compliance with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part. Recision of, or a commitment in writing signed by an authorized official of the airport operator to rescind or permanently not enforce, a noncomplying restriction will be treated by the FAA as action restoring compliance with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part with respect to that restriction.

### §161.503   Informal resolution; notice of apparent violation.

Prior to the initiation of formal action to terminate eligibility for airport grant funds or authority to impose or collect passenger facility charges under this subpart, the FAA shall undertake informal resolution with the airport operator to assure compliance with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part upon receipt of a complaint or other evidence that an airport operator has taken action to impose a noise or access restriction that appears to be in violation. This shall not preclude a FAA application for expedited judicial action for other than termination of airport grants and passenger facility charges to protect the national aviation system and violated federal interests. If informal resolution is not successful, the FAA will notify the airport operator in writing of the apparent violation. The airport operator shall respond to the notice in writing not later than 20 days after receipt of the notice, and also state whether the airport operator will agree to defer implementation or enforcement of its noise or access restriction until completion of the process under this subpart to determine compliance.

### §161.505   Notice of proposed termination of airport grant funds and passenger facility charges.

\(a\) The FAA begins proceedings under this section to terminate an airport operator's eligibility for airport grant funds and authority to impose or collect passenger facility charges only if the FAA determines that informal resolution is not successful.

\(b\) The following procedures shall apply if an airport operator agrees in writing, within 20 days of receipt of the FAA's notice of apparent violation under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.503   Informal resolution; notice of apparent violation.\|§161.503]], to defer implementation or enforcement of a noise or access restriction until completion of the process under this subpart to determine compliance.

\(1\) The FAA will issue a notice of proposed termination to the airport operator and publish notice of the proposed action in the Federal Register. This notice will state the scope of the proposed termination, the basis for the proposed action, and the date for filing written comments or objections by all interested parties. This notice will also identify any corrective action the airport operator can take to avoid further proceedings. The due date for comments and corrective action by the airport operator shall be specified in the notice of proposed termination and shall not be less than 60 days after publication of the notice.

\(2\) The FAA will review the comments, statements, and data supplied by the airport operator, and any other available information, to determine if the airport operator has provided satisfactory evidence of compliance or has taken satisfactory corrective action. The FAA will consult with the airport operator to attempt resolution and may request additional information from other parties to determine compliance. The review and consultation process shall take not less than 30 days. If the FAA finds satisfactory evidence of compliance, the FAA will notify the airport operator in writing and publish notice of compliance in the Federal Register.

\(3\) If the FAA determines that the airport operator has taken action to impose a noise or access restriction in violation of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part, the FAA will notify the airport operator in writing of such determination. Where appropriate, the FAA may prescribe corrective action, including corrective action the airport operator may still need to take. Within 10 days of receipt of the FAA's determination, the airport operator shall—

\(i\) Advise the FAA in writing that it will complete any corrective action prescribed by the FAA within 30 days; or

\(ii\) Provide the FAA with a list of the domestic air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at the airport and all other issuing carriers, as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0158 Passenger facility charges (pfc's)#§158.3   Definitions.\|§158.3]] of this chapter, that have remitted passenger facility charge revenue to the airport in the preceding 12 months.

\(4\) If the FAA finds that the airport operator has taken satisfactory corrective action, the FAA will notify the airport operator in writing and publish notice of compliance in the Federal Register. If the FAA has determined that the airport operator has imposed a noise or access restriction in violation of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part and satisfactory corrective action has not been taken, the FAA will issue an order that—

\(i\) Terminates eligibility for new airport grant agreements and discontinues payments of airport grant funds, including payments of costs incurred prior to the notice; and

\(ii\) Terminates authority to impose or collect a passenger facility charge or, if the airport operator has not received approval to impose a passenger facility charge, advises the airport operator that future applications for such approval will be denied in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0158 Passenger facility charges (pfc's)#§158.29   The Administrator's decision.\|§158.29]](a)(1)(v) of this chapter.

\(5\) The FAA will publish notice of the order in the Federal Register and notify air carriers of the FAA's order and actions to be taken to terminate or modify collection of passenger facility charges in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0158 Passenger facility charges (pfc's)#§158.85   Termination of authority to impose PFC's.\|§158.85]](f) of this chapter.

\(c\) The following procedures shall apply if an airport operator does not agree in writing, within 20 days of receipt of the FAA's notice of apparent violation under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/I Airports/0161 Notice and approval of airport noise and access restrictions#§161.503   Informal resolution; notice of apparent violation.\|§161.503]], to defer implementation or enforcement of its noise or access restriction until completion of the process under this subpart to determine compliance.

\(1\) The FAA will issue a notice of proposed termination to the airport operator and publish notice of the proposed action in the Federal Register. This notice will state the scope of the proposed termination, the basis for the proposed action, and the date for filing written comments or objections by all interested parties. This notice will also identify any corrective action the airport operator can take to avoid further proceedings. The due date for comments and corrective action by the airport operator shall be specified in the notice of proposed termination and shall not be less than 30 days after publication of the notice.

\(2\) The FAA will review the comments, statements, and data supplied by the airport operator, and any other available information, to determine if the airport operator has provided satisfactory evidence of compliance or has taken satisfactory corrective action. If the FAA finds satisfactory evidence of compliance, the FAA will notify the airport operator in writing and publish notice of compliance in the Federal Register.

\(3\) If the FAA determines that the airport operator has taken action to impose a noise or access restriction in violation of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part, the procedures in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(5) of this section will be followed.

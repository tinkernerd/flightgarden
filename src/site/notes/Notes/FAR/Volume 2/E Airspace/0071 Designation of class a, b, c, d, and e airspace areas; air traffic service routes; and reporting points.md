\(b\) The airspace areas designated for an airport in subpart E of FAA Order 7400.11E (incorporated by reference, see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/E Airspace/0071 Designation of class a, b, c, d, and e airspace areas; air traffic service routes; and reporting points#§71.1   Applicability.\|§71.1]]) within which all aircraft operators are subject to the operating rules specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules\|part 91 of this chapter]].

\(c\) The airspace areas listed as domestic airspace areas in subpart E of FAA Order 7400.11E (incorporated by reference, see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/E Airspace/0071 Designation of class a, b, c, d, and e airspace areas; air traffic service routes; and reporting points#§71.1   Applicability.\|§71.1]]) which extend upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth when designated in conjunction with an airport for which an approved instrument approach procedure has been prescribed, or from 1,200 feet or more above the surface of the earth for the purpose of transitioning to or from the terminal or en route environment. When such areas are designated in conjunction with airways or routes, the extent of such designation has the lateral extent identical to that of a Federal airway and extends upward from 1,200 feet or higher. Unless otherwise specified, the airspace areas in the paragraph extend upward from 1,200 feet or higher above the surface to, but not including, 14,500 feet MSL.

\(d\) The Federal airways described in subpart E of FAA Order 7400.11E (incorporated by reference, see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/E Airspace/0071 Designation of class a, b, c, d, and e airspace areas; air traffic service routes; and reporting points#§71.1   Applicability.\|§71.1]]).

\(e\) The airspace areas listed as en route domestic airspace areas in subpart E of FAA Order 7400.11E (incorporated by reference, see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/E Airspace/0071 Designation of class a, b, c, d, and e airspace areas; air traffic service routes; and reporting points#§71.1   Applicability.\|§71.1]]). Unless otherwise specified, each airspace area has a lateral extent identical to that of a Federal airway and extends upward from 1,200 feet above the surface of the earth to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace.

\(f\) The airspace areas listed as offshore airspace areas in subpart E of FAA Order 7400.11E (incorporated by reference, see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/E Airspace/0071 Designation of class a, b, c, d, and e airspace areas; air traffic service routes; and reporting points#§71.1   Applicability.\|§71.1]]) that are designated in international airspace within areas of domestic radio navigational signal or ATC radar coverage, and within which domestic ATC procedures are applied. Unless otherwise specified, each airspace area extends upward from a specified altitude up to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL.

## Subpart H—Reporting Points

### §71.901   Applicability.

Unless otherwise designated:

\(a\) Each reporting point listed in subpart H of FAA Order 7400.11E (incorporated by reference, see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/E Airspace/0071 Designation of class a, b, c, d, and e airspace areas; air traffic service routes; and reporting points#§71.1   Applicability.\|§71.1]]) applies to all directions of flight. In any case where a geographic location is designated as a reporting point for less than all airways passing through that point, or for a particular direction of flight along an airway only, it is so indicated by including the airways or direction of flight in the designation of geographical location.

\(b\) Place names appearing in the reporting point descriptions indicate VOR or VORTAC facilities identified by those names.

### Section 2. *Definitions and abbreviations*

For the purposes of this SFAR, the following definitions and abbreviations apply.

*Area navigation (RNAV).* RNAV is a method of navigation that permits aircraft operations on any desired flight path.

*Area navigation (RNAV) route.* RNAV route is a published route based on RNAV that can be used by suitably equipped aircraft.

*Certificate holder.* A certificate holder means a person holding a certificate issued under part 119 or [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0125 Certification and operations  airplanes having a seating capacity of 20 or more passengers or a maximum payload capacity of 6,000 pounds or more; and rules governing persons on board such aircraft\|part 125 of this chapter]] or holding operations specifications issued under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0129 Operations  foreign air carriers and foreign operators of u.s.-registered aircraft engaged in common carriage\|part 129 of this chapter]].

*Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).* GNSS is a world-wide position and time determination system that uses satellite ranging signals to determine user location. It encompasses all satellite ranging technologies, including GPS and additional satellites. Components of the GNSS include GPS, the Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System, and WAAS satellites.

*Global Positioning System (GPS).* GPS is a satellite-based radio navigational, positioning, and time transfer system. The system provides highly accurate position and velocity information and precise time on a continuous global basis to properly equipped users.

*Minimum crossing altitude (MCA).* The minimum crossing altitude (MCA) applies to the operation of an aircraft proceeding to a higher minimum en route altitude when crossing specified fixes.

*Required navigation system.* Required navigation system means navigation equipment that meets the performance requirements of TSO C145a/C146a navigation systems certified for IFR en route operations.

*Route segment.* Route segment is a portion of a route bounded on each end by a fix or NAVAID.

*Special MEA.* Special MEA refers to the minimum en route altitudes, using required navigation systems, on published routes outside the operational service volume of ground-based navigation aids and are depicted on the published Low Altitude and High Altitude En Route Charts using the color blue and with the suffix “G.” For example, a GPS MEA of 4000 feet MSL would be depicted using the color blue, as 4000G.

*Standard MEA.* Standard MEA refers to the minimum en route IFR altitude on published routes that uses ground-based navigation aids and are depicted on the published Low Altitude and High Altitude En Route Charts using the color black.

*Station referenced.* Station referenced refers to radio navigational aids or fixes that are referenced by ground based navigation facilities such as VOR facilities.

*Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).* WAAS is an augmentation to GPS that calculates GPS integrity and correction data on the ground and uses geo-stationary satellites to broadcast GPS integrity and correction data to GPS/WAAS users and to provide ranging signals. It is a safety critical system consisting of a ground network of reference and integrity monitor data processing sites to assess current GPS performance, as well as a space segment that broadcasts that assessment to GNSS users to support en route through precision approach navigation. Users of the system include all aircraft applying the WAAS data and ranging signal.

\(i\) *Operations on unpublished routes and use of radar in instrument approach procedures.* When radar is approved at certain locations for ATC purposes, it may be used not only for surveillance and precision radar approaches, as applicable, but also may be used in conjunction with instrument approach procedures predicated on other types of radio navigational aids. Radar vectors may be authorized to provide course guidance through the segments of an approach to the final course or fix. When operating on an unpublished route or while being radar vectored, the pilot, when an approach clearance is received, shall, in addition to complying with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.177   Minimum altitudes for IFR operations.\|§91.177]], maintain the last altitude assigned to that pilot until the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure unless a different altitude is assigned by ATC. After the aircraft is so established, published altitudes apply to descent within each succeeding route or approach segment unless a different altitude is assigned by ATC. Upon reaching the final approach course or fix, the pilot may either complete the instrument approach in accordance with a procedure approved for the facility or continue a surveillance or precision radar approach to a landing.

\(j\) *Limitation on procedure turns.* In the case of a radar vector to a final approach course or fix, a timed approach from a holding fix, or an approach for which the procedure specifies “No PT,” no pilot may make a procedure turn unless cleared to do so by ATC.

\(k\) *ILS components.* The basic components of an ILS are the localizer, glide slope, and outer marker, and, when installed for use with Category II or Category III instrument approach procedures, an inner marker. The following means may be used to substitute for the outer marker: Compass locator; precision approach radar (PAR) or airport surveillance radar (ASR); DME, VOR, or nondirectional beacon fixes authorized in the standard instrument approach procedure; or a suitable RNAV system in conjunction with a fix identified in the standard instrument approach procedure. Applicability of, and substitution for, the inner marker for a Category II or III approach is determined by the appropriate [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0097 Standard instrument procedures\|14 CFR part 97]] approach procedure, letter of authorization, or operations specifications issued to an operator.

### §91.176   Straight-in landing operations below DA/DH or MDA using an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) under IFR.

\(a\) *EFVS operations to touchdown and rollout.* Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator to use an MDA as a DA/DH with vertical navigation on an instrument approach procedure, or unless paragraph (d) of this section applies, no person may conduct an EFVS operation in an aircraft, except a military aircraft of the United States, at any airport below the authorized DA/DH to touchdown and rollout unless the minimums used for the particular approach procedure being flown include a DA or DH, and the following requirements are met:

\(1\) *Equipment.* (i) The aircraft must be equipped with an operable EFVS that meets the applicable airworthiness requirements. The EFVS must:

\(A\) Have an electronic means to provide a display of the forward external scene topography (the applicable natural or manmade features of a place or region especially in a way to show their relative positions and elevation) through the use of imaging sensors, including but not limited to forward-looking infrared, millimeter wave radiometry, millimeter wave radar, or low-light level image intensification.

\(B\) Present EFVS sensor imagery, aircraft flight information, and flight symbology on a head up display, or an equivalent display, so that the imagery, information and symbology are clearly visible to the pilot flying in his or her normal position with the line of vision looking forward along the flight path. Aircraft flight information and flight symbology must consist of at least airspeed, vertical speed, aircraft attitude, heading, altitude, height above ground level such as that provided by a radio altimeter or other device capable of providing equivalent performance, command guidance as appropriate for the approach to be flown, path deviation indications, flight path vector, and flight path angle reference cue. Additionally, for aircraft other than rotorcraft, the EFVS must display flare prompt or flare guidance.

\(C\) Present the displayed EFVS sensor imagery, attitude symbology, flight path vector, and flight path angle reference cue, and other cues, which are referenced to the EFVS sensor imagery and external scene topography, so that they are aligned with, and scaled to, the external view.

\(D\) Display the flight path angle reference cue with a pitch scale. The flight path angle reference cue must be selectable by the pilot to the desired descent angle for the approach and be sufficient to monitor the vertical flight path of the aircraft.

\(E\) Display the EFVS sensor imagery, aircraft flight information, and flight symbology such that they do not adversely obscure the pilot's outside view or field of view through the cockpit window.

\(F\) Have display characteristics, dynamics, and cues that are suitable for manual control of the aircraft to touchdown in the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing and during rollout.

\(ii\) When a minimum flightcrew of more than one pilot is required, the aircraft must be equipped with a display that provides the pilot monitoring with EFVS sensor imagery. Any symbology displayed may not adversely obscure the sensor imagery of the runway environment.

\(2\) *Operations.* (i) The pilot conducting the EFVS operation may not use circling minimums.

\(ii\) Each required pilot flightcrew member must have adequate knowledge of, and familiarity with, the aircraft, the EFVS, and the procedures to be used.

\(iii\) The aircraft must be equipped with, and the pilot flying must use, an operable EFVS that meets the equipment requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

\(iv\) When a minimum flightcrew of more than one pilot is required, the pilot monitoring must use the display specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) to monitor and assess the safe conduct of the approach, landing, and rollout.

\(v\) The aircraft must continuously be in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers.

### §91.818   Special flight authorization to exceed Mach 1.

For all civil aircraft, any operation that exceeds Mach 1 may be conducted only in accordance with a special flight authorization issued to an operator in accordance with the requirements of this section.

\(a\) *Application.* Application for a special flight authorization to exceed Mach 1 must be made to the FAA Office of Environment and Energy for consideration by the Administrator. Each application must include:

\(1\) The name of the operator;

\(2\) The number and model(s) of the aircraft to be operated;

\(3\) The number of proposed flights;

\(4\) The date range during which the flight(s) would be conducted;

\(5\) The time of day the flight(s) would be conducted. Proposed night operations may require further justification for their necessity;

\(6\) A description of the flight area requested by the applicant, including any environmental information required to be submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section;

\(7\) All conditions and limitations on the flight(s) that will ensure that no measurable sonic boom overpressure will reach the surface outside of the proposed flight area; and

\(8\) The reason(s) that operation at a speed greater than Mach 1 is necessary. A special flight authorization to exceed Mach 1 may be granted only for operations that are intended to:

\(i\) Show compliance with airworthiness requirements;

\(ii\) Determine the sonic boom characteristics of an aircraft;

\(iii\) Establish a means of reducing or eliminating the effects of sonic boom, including flight profiles and special features of an aircraft;

\(iv\) Demonstrate the conditions and limitations under which speeds in excess of Mach 1 will not cause a measurable sonic boom overpressure to reach the surface; or

\(v\) Measure the noise characteristics of an aircraft to demonstrate compliance with noise requirements imposed under this chapter, or to determine the limits for operation in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.817   Civil aircraft sonic boom.\|§91.817]](b).

\(9\) For any purpose listed in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, each applicant must indicate why its intended operation cannot be safely or properly accomplished over the ocean at a distance ensuring that no sonic boom overpressure reaches any land surface in the United States.

\(b\) *Operation outside a test area.* An applicant may apply for an authorization to conduct flights outside a test area under certain conditions and limitations upon a conservative showing that:

\(1\) Flight(s) within a test area have been conducted in accordance with an authorization issued for the purpose specified in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section;

\(2\) The results of the flight test(s) required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section demonstrate that a speed in excess of Mach 1 does not cause a measurable sonic boom overpressure to reach the surface; and

\(3\) The conditions and limitations determined by the test(s) represent all foreseeable operating conditions and are effective on all flights conducted under an authorization.

\(c\) *Environmental findings.* (1) No special flight authorization will be granted if the Administrator finds that such action is necessary to protect or enhance the environment.

\(2\) The Administrator is required to consider the potential environmental impacts resulting from the issuance of an authorization for a particular flight area pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C 4321 *et seq.*), all applicable regulations implementing NEPA, and related Executive orders and guidance. Accordingly, each applicant must provide information that sufficiently describes the potential environmental impact of any flight in excess of Mach 1, including the effect of a sonic boom reaching the surface in the proposed flight area, to enable the FAA to determine whether such impacts are significant within the meaning of NEPA.

\(d\) *Issuance.* An authorization to operate a civil aircraft in excess of Mach 1 may be issued only after an applicant has submitted the information described in this section and the Administrator has taken the required action regarding the environmental findings described in paragraph (c) of this section.

\(e\) *Duration.* (1) An authorization to exceed Mach 1 will be granted for the time the Administrator determines necessary to conduct the flights for the described purposes.

\(2\) An authorization to exceed Mach 1 is effective until it expires or is surrendered.

\(3\) An authorization to exceed Mach 1 may be terminated, suspended, or amended by the Administrator at any time the Administrator finds that such action is necessary to protect the environment.

\(4\) The holder of an authorization to exceed Mach 1 may request reconsideration of a termination, amendment, or suspension issued under paragraph (e)(3) of this section within 30 days of notice of the action. Failure to request reconsideration and provide information why the Administrator's action is not appropriate will result in permanent termination of the authorization.

\(5\) Findings made by and actions taken by the Administrator under this section do not affect any certificate issued under chapter 447 of Title 49 of the United States Code.

## Subpart K—Fractional Ownership Operations

### §91.1001   Applicability.

\(a\) This subpart prescribes rules, in addition to those prescribed in other subparts of this part, that apply to fractional owners and fractional ownership program managers governing—

\(1\) The provision of program management services in a fractional ownership program;

\(2\) The operation of a fractional ownership program aircraft in a fractional ownership program; and

\(3\) The operation of a program aircraft included in a fractional ownership program managed by an affiliate of the manager of the program to which the owner belongs.

\(b\) As used in this part—

\(1\) *Affiliate of a program manager* means a manager that, directly, or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another program manager. The holding of at least forty percent (40 percent) of the equity and forty percent (40 percent) of the voting power of an entity will be presumed to constitute control for purposes of determining an affiliation under this subpart.

\(2\) A *dry-lease aircraft exchange* means an arrangement, documented by the written program agreements, under which the program aircraft are available, on an as needed basis without crew, to each fractional owner.

\(3\) A *fractional owner or owner* means an individual or entity that possesses a minimum fractional ownership interest in a program aircraft and that has entered into the applicable program agreements; provided, however, that in the case of the flight operations described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, and solely for purposes of requirements pertaining to those flight operations, the fractional owner operating the aircraft will be deemed to be a fractional owner in the program managed by the affiliate.

\(4\) A *fractional ownership interest* means the ownership of an interest or holding of a multi-year leasehold interest and/or a multi-year leasehold interest that is convertible into an ownership interest in a program aircraft.

\(5\) A *fractional ownership program or program* means any system of aircraft ownership and exchange that consists of all of the following elements:

\(i\) The provision for fractional ownership program management services by a single fractional ownership program manager on behalf of the fractional owners.

\(ii\) Two or more airworthy aircraft.

\(iii\) One or more fractional owners per program aircraft, with at least one program aircraft having more than one owner.

\(iv\) Possession of at least a minimum fractional ownership interest in one or more program aircraft by each fractional owner.

\(v\) A dry-lease aircraft exchange arrangement among all of the fractional owners.

\(vi\) Multi-year program agreements covering the fractional ownership, fractional ownership program management services, and dry-lease aircraft exchange aspects of the program.

\(6\) A *fractional ownership program aircraft or program aircraft* means:

\(i\) An aircraft in which a fractional owner has a minimal fractional ownership interest and that has been included in the dry-lease aircraft exchange pursuant to the program agreements, or

\(ii\) In the case of a fractional owner from one program operating an aircraft in a different fractional ownership program managed by an affiliate of the operating owner's program manager, the aircraft being operated by the fractional owner, so long as the aircraft is:

\(A\) Included in the fractional ownership program managed by the affiliate of the operating owner's program manager, and

\(B\) Included in the operating owner's program's dry-lease aircraft exchange pursuant to the program agreements of the operating owner's program.

\(iii\) An aircraft owned in whole or in part by the program manager that has been included in the dry-lease aircraft exchange and is used to supplement program operations.

\(7\) A *Fractional Ownership Program Flight or Program Flight* means a flight under this subpart when one or more passengers or property designated by a fractional owner are on board the aircraft.

\(8\) *Fractional ownership program management services or program management services* mean administrative and aviation support services furnished in accordance with the applicable requirements of this subpart or provided by the program manager on behalf of the fractional owners, including, but not limited to, the—

\(i\) Establishment and implementation of program safety guidelines;

\(ii\) Employment, furnishing, or contracting of pilots and other crewmembers;

\(iii\) Training and qualification of pilots and other crewmembers and personnel;

\(iv\) Scheduling and coordination of the program aircraft and crews;

\(a\) No program manager or any other person may permit a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane on a program flight to take off that airplane at a weight that (allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight to the destination or alternate airport) the weight of the airplane on arrival would exceed the landing weight in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination or alternate airport and the ambient temperature expected at the time of landing.

\(b\) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no program manager or any other person may permit a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane on a program flight to take off that airplane unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport, the following is assumed:

\(1\) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction, in still air.

\(2\) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling characteristics of that airplane, and considering other conditions such as landing aids and terrain.

\(c\) A program manager or other person flying a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane on a program flight may permit that airplane to take off at a weight in excess of that allowed by paragraph (b) of this section if all of the following conditions exist:

\(1\) The operation is conducted in accordance with an approved Destination Airport Analysis in that person's program operating manual that contains the elements listed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.1025   Program operating manual contents.\|§91.1025]](o).

\(2\) The airplane's weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 80 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport, the following is assumed:

\(i\) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction, in still air.

\(ii\) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling characteristics of that airplane, and considering other conditions such as landing aids and terrain.

\(3\) The operation is authorized by management specifications.

\(d\) No program manager or other person may select an airport as an alternate airport for a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane unless (based on the assumptions in paragraph (b) of this section) that airplane, at the weight expected at the time of arrival, can be brought to a full stop landing within 80 percent of the effective length of the runway from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway.

\(e\) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less than that required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section) has been approved for a specific type and model airplane and included in the Airplane Flight Manual, no person may take off a turbojet airplane when the appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that the runways at the destination or alternate airport may be wet or slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the effective runway length at the destination airport is at least 115 percent of the runway length required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

\(2\) The latest weather report issued by the weather reporting facility includes a current local altimeter setting for the destination airport. If no local altimeter setting is available at the destination airport, the pilot must obtain the current local altimeter setting from a source provided by the facility designated on the approach chart for the destination airport.

\(b\) For flight planning purposes, if the destination airport does not have a weather reporting facility described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the pilot must designate as an alternate an airport that has a weather reporting facility meeting that criteria.

\(c\) The MDA or Decision Altitude and visibility landing minimums prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0097 Standard instrument procedures\|part 97 of this chapter]] or in the program manager's management specifications are increased by 100 feet and 1⁄2 mile respectively, but not to exceed the ceiling and visibility minimums for that airport when used as an alternate airport, for each pilot in command of a turbine-powered aircraft who has not served at least 100 hours as pilot in command in that type of aircraft.

\(d\) No person may take off an aircraft under IFR from an airport where weather conditions are at or above takeoff minimums but are below authorized IFR landing minimums unless there is an alternate airport within one hour's flying time (at normal cruising speed, in still air) of the airport of departure.

\(e\) Except as provided in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.176   Straight-in landing operations below DA/DH or MDA using an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) under IFR.\|§91.176]] of this chapter, each pilot making an IFR takeoff or approach and landing at an airport must comply with applicable instrument approach procedures and takeoff and landing weather minimums prescribed by the authority having jurisdiction over the airport. In addition, no pilot may take off at that airport when the visibility is less than 600 feet, unless otherwise authorized in the program manager's management specifications for EFVS operations.

### §91.1057   Flight, duty and rest time requirements: All crewmembers.

\(a\) For purposes of this subpart—

*Augmented flight crew* means at least three pilots.

*Calendar day* means the period of elapsed time, using Coordinated Universal Time or local time that begins at midnight and ends 24 hours later at the next midnight.

*Duty period* means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment by the program manager. All time between these two points is part of the duty period, even if flight time is interrupted by nonflight-related duties. The time is calculated using either Coordinated Universal Time or local time to reflect the total elapsed time.

*Extension of flight time* means an increase in the flight time because of circumstances beyond the control of the program manager or flight crewmember (such as adverse weather) that are not known at the time of departure and that prevent the flightcrew from reaching the destination within the planned flight time.

*Flight attendant* means an individual, other than a flight crewmember, who is assigned by the program manager, in accordance with the required minimum crew complement under the program manager's management specifications or in addition to that minimum complement, to duty in an aircraft during flight time and whose duties include but are not necessarily limited to cabin-safety-related responsibilities.

*Multi-time zone* flight means an easterly or westerly flight or multiple flights in one direction in the same duty period that results in a time zone difference of 5 or more hours and is conducted in a geographic area that is south of 60 degrees north latitude and north of 60 degrees south latitude.

*Reserve status* means that status in which a flight crewmember, by arrangement with the program manager: Holds himself or herself fit to fly to the extent that this is within the control of the flight crewmember; remains within a reasonable response time of the aircraft as agreed between the flight crewmember and the program manager; and maintains a ready means whereby the flight crewmember may be contacted by the program manager. Reserve status is not part of any duty period or rest period.

*Rest period* means a period of time required pursuant to this subpart that is free of all responsibility for work or duty prior to the commencement of, or following completion of, a duty period, and during which the flight crewmember or flight attendant cannot be required to receive contact from the program manager. A rest period does not include any time during which the program manager imposes on a flight crewmember or flight attendant any duty or restraint, including any actual work or present responsibility for work should the occasion arise.

*Standby* means that portion of a duty period during which a flight crewmember is subject to the control of the program manager and holds himself or herself in a condition of readiness to undertake a flight. Standby is not part of any rest period.

\(b\) A program manager may assign a crewmember and a crewmember may accept an assignment for flight time only when the applicable requirements of this section and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.1059   Flight time limitations and rest requirements: One or two pilot crews.\|§§91.1059]]-91.1062 are met.

\(c\) No program manager may assign any crewmember to any duty during any required rest period.

\(d\) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a program manager requires of a crewmember and provides to transport the crewmember to an airport at which he or she is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which he or she was relieved from duty to return to his or her home station, is not considered part of a rest period.

\(e\) A flight crewmember may continue a flight assignment if the flight to which he or she is assigned would normally terminate within the flight time limitations, but because of circumstances beyond the control of the program manager or flight crewmember (such as adverse weather conditions), is not at the time of departure expected to reach its destination within the planned flight time. The extension of flight time under this paragraph may not exceed the maximum time limits set forth in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.1059   Flight time limitations and rest requirements: One or two pilot crews.\|§91.1059]].

\(f\) Each flight assignment must provide for at least 10 consecutive hours of rest during the 24-hour period that precedes the completion time of the assignment.

\(g\) The program manager must provide each crewmember at least 13 rest periods of at least 24 consecutive hours each in each calendar quarter.

\(h\) A flight crewmember may decline a flight assignment if, in the flight crewmember's determination, to do so would not be consistent with the standard of safe operation required under this subpart, this part, and applicable provisions of this title.

\(i\) Any rest period required by this subpart may occur concurrently with any other rest period.

\(j\) If authorized by the Administrator, a program manager may use the applicable unscheduled flight time limitations, duty period limitations, and rest requirements of part 121 or [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft\|part 135 of this chapter]] instead of the flight time limitations, duty period limitations, and rest requirements of this subpart.

### §91.1059   Flight time limitations and rest requirements: One or two pilot crews.

\(a\) No program manager may assign any flight crewmember, and no flight crewmember may accept an assignment, for flight time as a member of a one- or two-pilot crew if that crewmember's total flight time in all commercial flying will exceed—

\(1\) 500 hours in any calendar quarter;

\(2\) 800 hours in any two consecutive calendar quarters;

\(3\) 1,400 hours in any calendar year.

\(b\) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, during any 24 consecutive hours the total flight time of the assigned flight, when added to any commercial flying by that flight crewmember, may not exceed—

\(1\) 8 hours for a flight crew consisting of one pilot; or

\(2\) 10 hours for a flight crew consisting of two pilots qualified under this subpart for the operation being conducted.

### Appendix G to Part 91—Operations in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace

### Section 1. Definitions

*Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace.* Within RVSM airspace, air traffic control (ATC) separates aircraft by a minimum of 1,000 feet vertically between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive. Air-traffic control notifies operators of RVSM airspace by providing route planning information.

*RVSM Group Aircraft.* Aircraft within a group of aircraft, approved as a group by the Administrator, in which each of the aircraft satisfy each of the following:

\(a\) The aircraft have been manufactured to the same design, and have been approved under the same type certificate, amended type certificate, or supplemental type certificate.

\(b\) The static system of each aircraft is installed in a manner and position that is the same as those of the other aircraft in the group. The same static source error correction is incorporated in each aircraft of the group.

\(c\) The avionics units installed in each aircraft to meet the minimum RVSM equipment requirements of this appendix are:

\(1\) Manufactured to the same manufacturer specification and have the same part number; or

\(2\) Of a different manufacturer or part number, if the applicant demonstrates that the equipment provides equivalent system performance.

*RVSM Nongroup Aircraft.* An aircraft that is approved for RVSM operations as an individual aircraft.

*RVSM Flight envelope.* An RVSM flight envelope includes the range of Mach number, weight divided by atmospheric pressure ratio, and altitudes over which an aircraft is approved to be operated in cruising flight within RVSM airspace. RVSM flight envelopes are defined as follows:

\(a\) The *full RVSM flight envelope* is bounded as follows:

\(1\) The altitude flight envelope extends from FL 290 upward to the lowest altitude of the following:

\(i\) FL 410 (the RVSM altitude limit);

\(ii\) The maximum certificated altitude for the aircraft; or

\(iii\) The altitude limited by cruise thrust, buffet, or other flight limitations.

\(2\) The airspeed flight envelope extends:

\(i\) From the airspeed of the slats/flaps-up maximum endurance (holding) airspeed, or the maneuvering airspeed, whichever is lower;

\(ii\) To the maximum operating airspeed (Vmo/Mmo), or airspeed limited by cruise thrust buffet, or other flight limitations, whichever is lower.

\(3\) All permissible gross weights within the flight envelopes defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition.

\(b\) The *basic RVSM flight envelope* is the same as the full RVSM flight envelope except that the airspeed flight envelope extends:

\(1\) From the airspeed of the slats/flaps-up maximum endurance (holding) airspeed, or the maneuver airspeed, whichever is lower;

\(2\) To the upper Mach/airspeed boundary defined for the full RVSM flight envelope, or a specified lower value not less than the long-range cruise Mach number plus .04 Mach, unless further limited by available cruise thrust, buffet, or other flight limitations.

### Section 2. Aircraft Approval

\(a\) Except as specified in Section 9 of this appendix, an operator may be authorized to conduct RVSM operations if the Administrator finds that its aircraft comply with this section.

\(b\) The applicant for authorization shall submit the appropriate data package for aircraft approval. The package must consist of at least the following:

\(1\) An identification of the RVSM aircraft group or the nongroup aircraft;

\(2\) A definition of the RVSM flight envelopes applicable to the subject aircraft;

\(3\) Documentation that establishes compliance with the applicable RVSM aircraft requirements of this section; and

\(4\) The conformity tests used to ensure that aircraft approved with the data package meet the RVSM aircraft requirements.

\(c\) *Altitude-keeping equipment: All aircraft.* To approve an aircraft group or a nongroup aircraft, the Administrator must find that the aircraft meets the following requirements:

\(1\) The aircraft must be equipped with two operational independent altitude measurement systems.

\(2\) The aircraft must be equipped with at least one automatic altitude control system that controls the aircraft altitude—

\(i\) Within a tolerance band of ±65 feet about an acquired altitude when the aircraft is operated in straight and level flight under nonturbulent, nongust conditions; or

\(ii\) Within a tolerance band of ±130 feet under nonturbulent, nongust conditions for aircraft for which application for type certification occurred on or before April 9, 1997 that are equipped with an automatic altitude control system with flight management/performance system inputs.

\(3\) The aircraft must be equipped with an altitude alert system that signals an alert when the altitude displayed to the flight crew deviates from the selected altitude by more than:

\(i\) ±300 feet for aircraft for which application for type certification was made on or before April 9, 1997; or

\(ii\) ±200 feet for aircraft for which application for type certification is made after April 9, 1997.

\(d\) *Altimetry system error containment: Group aircraft for which application for type certification was made on or before April 9, 1997.* To approve group aircraft for which application for type certification was made on or before April 9, 1997, the Administrator must find that the altimetry system error (ASE) is contained as follows:

\(1\) At the point in the basic RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 80 feet.

\(2\) At the point in the basic RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE plus three standard deviations reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 200 feet.

\(3\) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 120 feet.

\(4\) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE plus three standard deviations reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 245 feet.

\(5\) *Necessary operating restrictions.* If the applicant demonstrates that its aircraft otherwise comply with the ASE containment requirements, the Administrator may establish an operating restriction on that applicant's aircraft to restrict the aircraft from operating in areas of the basic RVSM flight envelope where the absolute value of mean ASE exceeds 80 feet, and/or the absolute value of mean ASE plus three standard deviations exceeds 200 feet; or from operating in areas of the full RVSM flight envelope where the absolute value of the mean ASE exceeds 120 feet and/or the absolute value of the mean ASE plus three standard deviations exceeds 245 feet.

\(e\) *Altimetry system error containment: Group aircraft for which application for type certification is made after April 9, 1997.* To approve group aircraft for which application for type certification is made after April 9, 1997, the Administrator must find that the altimetry system error (ASE) is contained as follows:

\(1\) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 80 feet.

\(2\) At the point in the full RVSM flight envelope where mean ASE plus three standard deviations reaches its largest absolute value, the absolute value may not exceed 200 feet.

\(f\) *Altimetry system error containment: Nongroup aircraft.* To approve a nongroup aircraft, the Administrator must find that the altimetry system error (ASE) is contained as follows:

\(1\) For each condition in the basic RVSM flight envelope, the largest combined absolute value for residual static source error plus the avionics error may not exceed 160 feet.

\(2\) For each condition in the full RVSM flight envelope, the largest combined absolute value for residual static source error plus the avionics error may not exceed 200 feet.

\(g\) Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Compatibility With RVSM Operations: All aircraft. After March 31, 2002, unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, if you operate an aircraft that is equipped with TCAS II in RVSM airspace, it must be a TCAS II that meets TSO C-119b (Version 7.0), or a later version.

\(h\) If the Administrator finds that the applicant's aircraft comply with this section, the Administrator notifies the applicant in writing.

### Section 3. Operator Authorization

\(a\) Except as specified in Section 9 of this appendix, authority for an operator to conduct flight in airspace where RVSM is applied is issued in operations specifications, a Letter of Authorization, or management specifications issued under subpart K of this part, as appropriate. To issue an RVSM authorization under this section, the Administrator must find that the operator's aircraft have been approved in accordance with Section 2 of this appendix and the operator complies with this section.

\(b\) Except as specified in Section 9 of this appendix, an applicant seeking authorization to operate within RVSM airspace must apply in a form and manner prescribed by the Administrator. The application must include the following:

\(1\) \[Reserved\]

\(2\) For an applicant who operates under part 121 or 135 of this chapter or under subpart K of this part, initial and recurring pilot training requirements.

\(3\) Policies and procedures: An applicant who operates under part 121 or 135 of this chapter or under subpart K of this part must submit RVSM policies and procedures that will enable it to conduct RVSM operations safely.

\(c\) In a manner prescribed by the Administrator, an operator seeking authorization under this section must provide evidence that:

\(1\) It is capable to operate and maintain each aircraft or aircraft group for which it applies for approval to operate in RVSM airspace; and

\(2\) Each pilot has knowledge of RVSM requirements, policies, and procedures sufficient for the conduct of operations in RVSM airspace.

### Section 4. RVSM Operations

\(a\) Each person requesting a clearance to operate within RVSM airspace shall correctly annotate the flight plan filed with air traffic control with the status of the operator and aircraft with regard to RVSM approval. Each operator shall verify RVSM applicability for the flight planned route through the appropriate flight planning information sources.

\(b\) No person may show, on the flight plan filed with air traffic control, an operator or aircraft as approved for RVSM operations, or operate on a route or in an area where RVSM approval is required, unless:

\(1\) The operator is authorized by the Administrator to perform such operations in accordance with Section 3 or Section 9 of this appendix, as applicable.

\(2\) The aircraft—

\(i\) Has been approved and complies with Section 2 this appendix; or

The Administrator may authorize an aircraft operator to deviate from the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.180   Operations within airspace designated as Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum airspace.\|§§91.180]] or 91.706 for a specific flight in RVSM airspace if—

\(a\) The operator submits a request in a time and manner acceptable to the Administrator; and

\(b\) At the time of filing the flight plan for that flight, ATC determines that the aircraft may be provided appropriate separation and that the flight will not interfere with, or impose a burden on, RVSM operations.

### Section 6. Reporting Altitude-Keeping Errors

Each operator shall report to the Administrator each event in which the operator's aircraft has exhibited the following altitude-keeping performance:

\(a\) Total vertical error of 300 feet or more;

\(b\) Altimetry system error of 245 feet or more; or

\(c\) Assigned altitude deviation of 300 feet or more.

### Section 7. Removal or Amendment of Authority

The Administrator may prohibit or restrict an operator from conducting operations in RVSM airspace, if the Administrator determines that the operator is not complying, or is unable to comply, with this appendix or subpart H of this part. Examples of reasons for amendment, revocation, or restriction include, but are not limited to, an operator's:

\(a\) Committing one or more altitude-keeping errors in RVSM airspace;

\(b\) Failing to make an effective and timely response to identify and correct an altitude-keeping error; or

\(c\) Failing to report an altitude-keeping error.

### Section 8. Airspace Designation

RVSM may be applied in all ICAO Flight Information Regions (FIRs).

### Section 9. Aircraft Equipped With Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Broadcast Out

An operator is authorized to conduct flight in airspace in which RVSM is applied provided:

\(a\) The aircraft is equipped with the following:

\(1\) Two operational independent altitude measurement systems.

\(2\) At least one automatic altitude control system that controls the aircraft altitude—

\(i\) Within a tolerance band of ±65 feet about an acquired altitude when the aircraft is operated in straight and level flight under nonturbulent, nongust conditions; or

\(ii\) Within a tolerance band of ±130 feet under nonturbulent, nongust conditions for aircraft for which application for type certification occurred on or before April 9, 1997, that are equipped with an automatic altitude control system with flight management/performance system inputs.

\(3\) An altitude alert system that signals an alert when the altitude displayed to the flightcrew deviates from the selected altitude by more than—

\(i\) ±300 feet for aircraft for which application for type certification was made on or before April 9, 1997; or

\(ii\) ±200 feet for aircraft for which application for type certification is made after April 9, 1997.

\(4\) A TCAS II that meets TSO C-119b (Version 7.0), or a later version, if equipped with TCAS II, unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator.

\(5\) Unless authorized by ATC or the foreign country where the aircraft is operated, an ADS-B Out system that meets the equipment performance requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.227   Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment performance requirements.\|§91.227]] of this part. The aircraft must have its height-keeping performance monitored in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator.

\(b\) The altimetry system error (ASE) of the aircraft does not exceed 200 feet when operating in RVSM airspace.

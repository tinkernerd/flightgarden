(*a*) Each participant shall pay for his deposit and subsequent payments comprising the charter participant's tariff fare only by check or money order payable to such bank which shall maintain a separate accounting for each flight: *Provided, however,* That if the participant makes a cash deposit, the charter operator who receives such cash deposit shall forthwith remit to the designated bank a check for the full amount of the deposit;

(*b*) The bank shall not pay the air carrier or foreign air carrier the charter price for the transportation earlier than 60 days (including day of departure) prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating or returning flight, upon certification of the departure date and price by the charter operator;

(*a*) Whenever the gross amount of customers' deposits exceeds 25 percent of the charter operator's net worth, as computed under generally accepted accounting principles, the charter operator shall, on or before the 30th day of the succeeding month, place in escrow or in trust with the bank cash in an amount at least equal to the amount by which such deposits exceed 25 percent of its net worth: *Provided,* That negotiable securities may be substituted for cash, but the market value thereof shall at all times be not less than the amount of cash for which they are substituted;

(*b*) The escrow agreement or the trust agreement between the bank and the operator shall not be effective until approved by the Department. Claims against the escrow or trust may be made only with respect to the nonperformance of air transportation.

\(b\) As used in this section, the term *bank* means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

\(c\) Any bond furnished under this section shall insure the financial responsibility of the charter operator and the supplying of the air transportation in accordance with the contract between the charter operator and the charter participants, and shall be in the form set forth as appendix A to this part.

The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which the charter originates or in which the charter operator is incorporated. For purposes of this section, the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia. The bond shall be specifically identified by the issuing surety with a company bond numbering system so that the Department may identify the bond with the specific charter or charters to which it relates: *Provided, however,* That these data may be set forth in an addendum attached to the bond which addendum must be signed by the charter operator and the surety company. It shall be effective on or before the date the operating authorization becomes effective. If the bond does not comply with the requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the Department will notify the direct air carrier and the charter operator, by registered or certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond. Unless such deficiencies are corrected within the time set forth in such notification, the subject charters shall in no event be operated.

\(d\) Any bond furnished under this section shall provide that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator, or, if he is unavailable, with the surety, within sixty (60) days after termination of the charter, the surety shall be released from all liability under the bond to such charter participant. The contract between the charter operator and the charter participants shall contain notice of this provision.

Know all persons by these presents, that we \_\_\_\_\_\_ (name of charter operator) of \_\_\_\_\_\_ (address) as Principal (hereinafter called “Principal”), and \_\_\_\_\_\_ (name of surety) a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of \_\_\_\_\_\_ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called “Surety”) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the sum of \_\_\_\_\_\_ (see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0372 Overseas military personnel charters#§372.24   Surety bond, depository agreement, escrow agreement.\|§372.24]](a), [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0372 Overseas military personnel charters\|14 CFR part 372]]) for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally firmly by these presents.

Whereas Principal is an overseas military personnel charter operator pursuant to the provisions of part 372 of the Department's regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to security for the protection of charter participants, and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will insure financial responsibility with respect to all monies received from charter participants for services in connection with overseas military personnel charters to be operated subject to part 372 of the Department's Special Regulations in accordance with contracts, agreements, or arrangements therefor, and

Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by Principal as an authorized charter operator with part 372 of the Department's regulations, and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to security for the protection of charter participants, and shall inure to the benefit of any and all charter participants to whom Principal may be held legally liable for any damages herein described.

Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to charter participants any sum or sums for which Principal may be held legally liable by reason of Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Principal while this bond is in effect with respect to the receipt of moneys from charter participants, and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of part 372 of the Department's regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.

The liability of Surety with respect to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.

The liability of Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty (face amount) of the bond, but in no event shall Surety's obligation hereunder exceed the amount of said penalty.

Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, forthwith of all suits or claims made and judgments rendered, and payments made by Surety under this bond.

This bond shall cover the following Charters:1

Principal or Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice to: U.S. Air Carrier Licensing/Special Authorities Division, Office of International Aviation, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590, such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after the actual receipt of said notice by the Department. Surety shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of any damages hereinbefore described which arise as a result of any contracts, agreements, undertakings, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal after the termination of this bond as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the bond hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as a result of contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal prior to the date that such termination becomes effective. Liability of Surety under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charter participant or charter participants who shall within sixty (60) days after the termination of the particular charter described herein give written notice of claim to the charter operator or, if it is unavailable, to Surety, and all liability on this bond shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination date of each particular charter covered by this bond except for claims made in the time provided herein.

## Subpart A—General Provisions

### §380.1   Applicability.

This part applies to Public Charter air transportation of passengers in interstate or foreign air transportation, whether furnished by direct air carriers or Public Charter operators. This part also relieves such charter operators from various provisions of subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (statute), for the purpose of enabling them to provide Public Charters utilizing aircraft chartered from such direct air carriers. It also declines jurisdiction over foreign Public Charter operators operating foreign-originating Public Charters.

\[Docket No. OST-97-2356, 63 FR 28241, May 22, 1998, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019\]

For the purposes of this part:

*Certificated air carrier* means a U.S. direct air carrier holding a certificate issued under the statute.

*Charter flight* means a flight operated under the terms of a charter contract between a direct air carrier and its customer. It does not include scheduled air transportation, scheduled foreign air transportation, or nonscheduled cargo air transportation, sold on an individually ticketed or individually waybilled basis.

*Direct air carrier* means a certificated commuter or foreign air carrier, or an air taxi operator registered under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0298 Exemptions for air taxi and commuter air carrier operations\|part 298 of this chapter]], or a Canadian charter air taxi operator registered under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0294 Canadian charter air taxi operators\|part 294 of this chapter]], that directly engages in the operation of aircraft under a certificate, authorization, permit or exemption issued by the Department.

*Educational institution* means a school that is operated as such on a year-round basis and is empowered to grant academic degrees or secondary school diplomas by any government in the United States or by a foreign government.

*Foreign air carrier* means a direct air carrier that holds a foreign air carrier permit issued under the statute or an exemption issued under the statute authorizing direct foreign air transportation.

*Foreign Public Charter operator* means an indirect air carrier which is not a citizen of the United States as defined in the statute, that is authorized to engage in the formation of groups for transportation on Public Charters in accordance with this part.

*Indirect air carrier* means any person who undertakes to engage indirectly in air transportation operations and who uses for such transportation the services of a direct air carrier.

*Public Charter* means a one-way or round-trip charter flight to be performed by one or more direct air carriers that is arranged and sponsored by a charter operator.

<div>

1If the credit card merchant account is separate from the depository account, it must be used solely as a conduit, i.e., all credit card payments toward Public Charter trips must be immediately remitted to the depository account in full, without holdback, or retention of any portion of the participant's payment. If the depository bank is not the credit card merchant bank, the Department must be satisfied that there are adequate procedural safeguards for the protection of participants' payments.

</div>

Termination means the date of arrival (or in the case of a canceled charter, the intended date of arrival) of the return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of the last flight in the participant's itinerary;

\(w\) For international flights only: That additional restrictions may be imposed on the flight by the foreign government involved, and that if landing rights are denied by a foreign government the flight will be canceled with a full refund to the participant. This statement need not be included in the contract if—

\(2\) All the foreign governments involved have adopted country-of-origin rules for charterworthiness;

\(x\) That the charter operator is the principal and is responsible to the participants for all services and accommodations offered in connection with the charter. However, the contract may expressly provide that the charter operator, unless negligent, is not responsible for personal injury or property damage caused by any direct air carrier, hotel or other supplier of services in connection with the charter.

### §380.33   Major changes in itinerary or price; refunds.

\(a\) For the purposes of this section, “major change” means any of the following:

\(1\) A change in the departure or return date shown in the operator-participant contract, (or, if the contract states alternative dates, the date designated to the participant by the charter operator in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.33   Major changes in itinerary or price; refunds.\|§380.33]]a(b)), unless the change results from a flight delay. In any event, however, a date change that the operator knows of more than 2 days before the scheduled flight date, and any delay of more than 48 hours, will be considered a major change.

\(2\) A change in the origin or destination city shown in the operator-participant contract for any flight leg (or, if the contract states alternative cities, the city designated to the participant by the operator in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.33   Major changes in itinerary or price; refunds.\|§380.33]]a(b)), unless the change affects only the order in which cities named in a tour package are visited.

<div>

2See also n.1, *supra.*

</div>

<div>

3“Holdback” is an amount in excess of usual commissions that a credit card merchant bank sometimes retains to cover potential charge-backs or other charges.

</div>

\(ii\) The bank shall pay the direct air carrier the charter price for the transportation not earlier than 60 days (including day of departure) prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating or returning flight, upon certification of the departure date by the air carrier: Provided, That, in the case of a round trip charter contract to be performed by one carrier, the total round trip charter price shall be paid to the carrier not earlier than 60 days prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating flight;

\(iii\) The bank shall reimburse the charter operator or foreign charter operator for refunds made by the latter to the charter participant upon written notification from the charter operator or foreign charter operator;

\(iv\) If the charter operator, foreign charter operator or the direct air carrier notifies the bank that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall make applicable refunds directly to the charter participants;

\(v\) After the charter price has been paid in full to the direct air carrier, the bank shall pay funds from the account directly to the hotels, sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies furnishing ground accommodations and services, if any, in connection with the charter or series of charters upon presentation to the bank of vendors' bills and upon certification by the charter operator or foreign charter operator of the amounts payable for such ground accommodations and services and the person or companies to whom payment is to be made: Provided, however, That the total amounts paid by the bank pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (v) of this section shall not exceed either the total cost of the air transportation, or 80 percent of the total deposits received by the bank less any refunds made to charter participants pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iv) of this section, whichever is greater;

\(vi\) As used in this section, the term “bank” means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;

\(vii\) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter group;

\(viii\) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the amount of total cash deposits required to be maintained in the depository account of the bank may be reduced by one or both of the following: The amount of the security agreement in the form prescribed in this section in excess of the minimum coverage required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section; an escrow with the designated bank of Federal, State, or municipal bonds or other securities, consisting of certificates of deposit issued by banks having a stated policy of redeeming such certificates before maturity at the request of the holder (subject only to such interest penalties or other conditions as may be required by law), or negotiable securities which are publicly traded on a securities exchange, all such securities to be made payable to the escrow account: Provided, That such other securities shall be substituted in an amount no greater than 80 percent of the total market value of the escrow account at the time of such substitution: And provided, further, That should the market value of such other securities subsequently decrease, from time to time, then additional cash or securities qualified for investment hereunder shall promptly be added to the escrow account, in an amount equal to the amount of such decreased value; and

\(ix\) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), and (viii) of this section, the bank shall not pay out any funds from the account prior to 2 banking days after completion of each charter, when the balance in the account shall be paid the charter operator or foreign charter operator, upon certification of the completion date by the direct air carrier: Provided, however, That if the Charter involves air transportation only and the bank has paid the direct air carrier(s) the charter price for the originating flight, and the returning flight if any, and has paid all refunds due to participants, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and (iii), respectively, of this section, then the bank may pay the balance in the account to the charter operator upon certification by the direct air carrier performing the originating flight that such flight has in fact departed.

(c)(1) The security agreement required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall insure the financial responsibility of the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the supplying of the transportation and all other accommodations, services, and facilities in accordance with the contract between the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the charter participants.

\(2\) The security agreement may be either:

\(i\) A surety bond in the form set forth as appendix A to this part;

\(ii\) A surety trust agreement in the form set forth as appendix B to this part; or

\(iii\) An arrangement with a bank (for instance, a standby letter of credit) that provides protection of charter participants' funds equivalent to or greater than that provided by the Bond in appendix A. An arrangement that furnishes a lesser degree of protection than would be provided under the bond shall be invalid to that extent, and instead the bank, the charter operator or foreign charter operator, and the charter participants shall have the same rights and liabilities as provided under a bond in the form of appendix A. If the arrangement does not give as much protection as a bond against the risk of the charter operator's bankruptcy, the bank shall be liable in the event of bankruptcy to the same extent as if it had entered into a bond.

\(3\) Any agreement under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall include a statement that, in the event that the other provisions of the agreement do not provide protection to charter participants comparable to that provided under a bond in the form of appendix A, the bank shall assume, for the benefit of the charter participants, all the liabilities it would have if it entered into the bond.

\(4\) The security agreement shall be effective on or before the date the charter prospectus is filed with the Department.

\(5\) The security agreement shall be specifically identified by the issuing securer with a numbering system so that the Department can identify the security agreement with the specific charter or charters to which it relates. These data may be set forth in an addendum attached to the security agreement, which addendum must be signed by the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the securer.

\(6\) When security is provided by a surety bond, such bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company that is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of “A” or better. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which the charter originates. For purposes of this section the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia.

\(7\) When security is provided by a security agreement other than a bond, the agreement shall be issued by a national bank complying with the provisions of 12 CFR 7.7010(a), or by a State bank complying with applicable State laws that give authority to issue such agreements, and all such banks must be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

\(d\) The security agreement required by this section shall provide that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator or foreign charter operator, or, if it is unavailable, with the securer, within 60 days after termination of the charter, the securer shall be released from all liability under the security agreement to such charter participant. Terminations means the date of arrival (or in the case of a canceled charter, the intended date of arrival) of the return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of the last flight in the participant's itinerary.

### §380.34a   Substitution of direct air carrier's security or depository agreement.

\(a\) A direct air carrier may substitute its own security agreement and/or depository arrangements, as specified in this section, for those required of the charter operator under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]], but only for charter trips in which all the air transportation is provided by one direct air carrier. Charter operators are relieved from [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]] to the extent that the direct carrier substitutes its own arrangements.

\(b\) The direct air carrier may substitute its security agreement for all of the arrangements required of the charter operator under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]] (a) or (b). Alternatively, it may substitute its depository agreement for the depository agreement required of the charter operator under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]](b)(2). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement, it may also obtain and substitute a security agreement for the one otherwise required of the charter operator under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]](b)(1). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement only, the charter operator must supply the security agreement required under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]](b)(1).

\(c\) If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement for all the charter operator's requirements under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]], the charter operator shall include in the charter prospectus, in place of the information in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.28   Charter prospectus.\|§380.28]](a)(2) regarding the charter operator's security agreement:

\(1\) A statement by the direct air carrier on OST Form 4535 that it will take responsibility for all charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations and services) and for the fulfillment of all the charter operator's contractual and regulatory obligations to the charter participants.

\(2\) A statement from the direct air carrier and its securer (under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0212 Charter rules for u.s. and foreign direct air carriers#§212.12   Waiver.\|§212.12]] of this chapter), OST Form 4533, that they have entered into a security agreement assuring the direct air carrier's responsibilities to charter participants under this section in an unlimited amount (except that the liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant), and that the securer has received a copy of the proposed flight schedule identified by the schedule number assigned by the charter operator under this part.

\(d\) A substitute depository agreement under this section shall be signed by the direct air carrier, the charter operator, and the depository bank, and shall provide, in addition to existing requirements under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0212 Charter rules for u.s. and foreign direct air carriers#§212.8   Protection of customers' payments.\|§212.8]] of this chapter, that:

\(1\) Payments by or on behalf of charter participants shall be allocated to the flight accounts matching the participant's itinerary in the following way: Each account shall have allocated to it the charter cost of the participant's air transportation on that flight. The portion of each payment not intended for air transportation services shall be allocated to the account for the return flight in the participant's itinerary. If there is only one flight in the itinerary, the entire payment shall be allocated to that account.

\(2\) The bank shall pay funds from a flight account directly to the hotels, sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies furnishing ground accommodations and services, if any, in connection with the charter flight, upon presentation to the bank of vendor's bills and upon certification by the person who contracted for the ground accommodations or services of the amounts payable and the persons or companies to whom payment is to be made, except that no disbursement shall be made that would reduce the balance in the account below the charter cost of the flight.

\(3\) On sales made to participants by a person other than a retail travel agent, the participant shall pay by check, money order, or credit card draft payable to the bank. On sales made to participants by a retail travel agent, payments shall be made in the same manner unless the agent deducts its commission and remits the balance to the bank by check, money order, or electronic transfer. The agent may deduct its commission only if it agrees in writing with its principal (the charter operator or direct air carrier, as applicable) that, if the charter is canceled, the agent shall remit to the bank the full amount of the commission previously deducted or received within 10 days after receipt of notification of the cancellation. The depository bank shall pay refunds directly to participants according to the terms of the operator-participant contract and the terms of this part.

\(e\) If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement in addition to substituting a depository agreement, the charter prospectus information must include all the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, except for the amount of the security agreement. That agreement shall be in an amount of at least \$10,000 times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more than \$200,000.

\(f\) A copy of the depository agreement under paragraph (d) of this section shall be filed with the Department, and it shall not be effective until approved by the Department.

\(g\) A copy of the security agreement under paragraph (c) or paragraph (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department. It shall insure the financial responsibility of the direct air carrier for supplying the transportation and all other accommodations, services, and facilities in accordance with the contracts between the charter operator and the charter participants. Such security agreement shall meet all the other requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters#§380.34   Security and depository agreements.\|§380.34]] (c) and (d).

### §380.35   Disbursements from depository account.

Know all persons by these presents, that we \_\_\_\_\_\_ (name of charter operator) \_\_\_\_\_\_ of\_\_\_\_\_\_ (city) \_\_\_\_\_\_ (state) as Principal (hereinafter called Principal), and \_\_\_\_\_\_ (name of surety) a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of \_\_\_\_\_\_ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the sum of \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(see 14 CFR 380.34) for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.

Whereas Principal intends to become a Public Charter operator pursuant to the provisions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters\|14 CFR part 380]] and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to insurance or other security for the protection of charter participants, and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will insure financial responsibility with respect to all moneys received from charter participants for services in connection with a Public Charter to be operated subject to part 380 of the Department's regulations in accordance with contracts, agreements, or arrangements therefore, and

Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by Principal as an authorized charter operator with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters\|14 CFR part 380]] and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to insurance and other security for the protection of charter participants, and shall inure to the benefit of any and all charter participants to whom Principal may be held legally liable for any damages herein described.

Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to charter participants any sum or sums for which Principal may be held legally liable by reason of Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Principal while this bond is in effect with respect to the receipt of moneys from charter participants, and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters\|14 CFR part 380]], then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.

The liability of Surety with respect to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.

The liability of Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty of the bond, but in no event shall Surety's obligation hereunder exceed the amount of said penalty.

Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the U.S. Air Carrier Licensing/Special Authorities Division, X-44, Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, forthwith of all suits or claims filed and judgments rendered, and payments made by Surety under this bond.

Surety shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of any damages hereinbefore described which arise as a result of any contracts, agreements, undertakings, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal after the termination of this bond as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the bond hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as a result of contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal prior to the date that such termination becomes effective. Liability of Surety under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charter participant or charter participants who shall within sixty (60) days after the termination of the particular charter described herein give written notice of claim to the charter operator or, if it is unavailable, to Surety, and all liability on this bond shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination date of each particular charter covered by this bond except for claims made in the time provided herein.

Operator intends to become a Public Charter operator pursuant to the provisions of part 380 of the Department's regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to insurance or other security for the protection of charter participants, and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a Surety Trust Agreement as will insure financial responsibility with respect to all monies received from charter participants for services in connection with a Public Charter to be operated subject to part 380 of the Department's regulations in accordance with contracts, agreements, or arrangements therefore.

This Surety Trust Agreement is written to assure compliance by Operator with the provisions of part 380 of the Department's regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to insurance or other security for the protection of charter participants. It shall inure to the benefit of any and all charter participants to whom Operator may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.

It is mutually agreed by and between Operator and Trustee that Trustee shall manage the corpus of the trust and carry out the purposes of the trust as hereinafter set forth during the term of the trust for the benefit of charter participants (who are hereinafter referred to as “Beneficiaries.”)

Beneficiaries of the trust created by this Agreement shall be limited to those charter participants who meet the following requirements:

1\. Those for whom Operator or Operator's agent has received payment toward participation in one or more charters operated by or proposed to be operated by Operator.

2\. Who have legal claim or claims for money damages against Operator by reason of Operator's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill, and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Operator while this trust is in effect with respect to the receipt of monies and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to part 380 of the Department's regulations; and

3\. Who have given notice of such claim or claims in accordance with this Trust Agreement, but who have not been paid by Operator.

The operator shall convey to Trustee legal title to the trust corpus, which has a value of \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by the time of the execution of this Agreement.

Trustee shall assume the responsibilities of Trustee over the said trust corpus and shall distribute from the trust corpus to any and all Beneficiaries to whom Operator, in its capacity as a Public Charter operator, may be held legally liable by reason of Operator's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill, and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Operator, while this trust is in effect with respect to the receipt of monies and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to part 380 of the Department's regulations in connection with said charters, such damages as will discharge such liability while this trust is in effect; *Provided, however,* that the liability of the trust to any Beneficiary shall not exceed the charter price (as defined in part 380 of the Department's regulations) paid by or on behalf of any such Beneficiary; *Provided, further,* that there shall be no obligation of the trust to any Beneficiary if Operator shall pay or cause to be paid to any Beneficiary any sum or sums for which Operator may be held legally liable by reasons of its failure faithfully to perform, fulfill, and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Operator in its capacity as Public Charter Operator while this trust is in effect with respect to the receipt of monies and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to part 380 of the Department's regulations; *and provided still further,* that the liability of the trust as administered by Trustee shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments, shall amount in the aggregate to \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the obligation of the trust or Trustee hereunder exceed the aggregate amount of \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Trustee agrees to furnish written notice to the U.S. Air Carrier Licensing/Special Authorities Division, X-44, Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, forthwith of all suits or claims filed and judgments rendered (of which it has knowledge), and of payments made by Trustee under the terms of this trust.

The trust shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of any damages hereinbefore described which arise as a result of any contracts, agreements, undertakings, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Operator after the termination of this trust as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the trust hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as a result of contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Operator prior to the date that such termination becomes effective.

Liability of the trust shall in all events be limited only to a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries who shall within sixty days after the termination of the particular charter give written notice of claim to Operator or, if it is unavailable, to Trustee, and all liability of the trust with respect to participants in a charter shall automatically terminate sixty days after the termination date of each particular charter covered by this trust except for claims made in the time provided herein.

Sixty-one days after the completion of the last charter covered by this Trust Agreement, the trust shall automatically terminate except for claims of any Beneficiary or Beneficiaries previously made in accordance with this Agreement still pending on and after said sixty-first day. To the extent of such claims, the trust shall continue until those claims are discharged, dismissed, dropped, or otherwise terminated. After all remaining claims which are covered by this Trust Agreement pending on and after the said sixty-first day have been discharged, dismissed, dropped, or otherwise terminated; Trustee shall convey forthwith the remainder of the trust corpus, if any, to Operator.

Either Operator or Trustee may at any time terminate this trust by written notice to: “U.S. Air Carrier Licensing/Special Authorities Division, X-44, Office of International Aviation, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, W-86-445, Washington, DC 20590,” such termination to become effective thirty days after the actual receipt of said notice by the Department.

In the event of any controversy or claim arising hereunder, Trustee shall not be required to determine same or take any other action with respect thereto, but may await the settlement of such controversy or claim by final appropriate legal proceedings, and in such event shall not be liable for interest or damages of any kind.

Any Successor to Trustee by merger, consolidation, or otherwise, shall succeed to this trusteeship and shall have the powers and obligations set forth in this Agreement.

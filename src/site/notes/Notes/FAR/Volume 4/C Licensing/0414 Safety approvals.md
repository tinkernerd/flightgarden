## Subpart A—General

### §414.1   Scope.

This part establishes procedures for obtaining a safety approval and renewing and transferring an existing safety approval. Safety approvals issued under this part may be used to support the application review for one or more launch or reentry license requests under other parts of this chapter.

### §414.3   Definitions.

*Safety approval.* For purposes of this part, a safety approval is an FAA document containing the FAA determination that one or more of the safety elements listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition, when used or employed within a defined envelope, parameter, or situation, will not jeopardize public health and safety or safety of property. A safety approval may be issued independent of a license, and it does not confer any authority to conduct activities for which a license is required under 14 CFR chapter III. A safety approval does not relieve its holder of the duty to comply with all applicable requirements of law or regulation that may apply to the holder's activities.

\(1\) Launch vehicle, reentry vehicle, safety system, process, service, or any identified component thereof; or

\(2\) Qualified and trained personnel, performing a process or function related to licensed launch activities or vehicles.

*Safety element.* For purposes of this part, a safety element is any one of the items or persons (personnel) listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of “safety approval” in this section.

### §414.5   Applicability.

This part applies to an applicant that wants to obtain a safety approval for any of the safety elements defined under this part and to persons granted a safety approval under this part. Any person eligible under this part may apply to become the holder of a safety approval.

### §414.7   Eligibility.

\(a\) There is no citizenship requirement to obtain a safety approval.

\(b\) You may be eligible for a safety approval if you are—

\(1\) A manufacturer or designer of a launch or reentry vehicle or component thereof;

\(2\) The designer or developer of a safety system or process; or

\(3\) Personnel who perform safety critical functions in conducting a licensed launch or reentry.

\(c\) A safety approval applicant must have sufficient knowledge and expertise to show that the design and operation of the safety element for which safety approval is sought qualify for a safety approval.

\(d\) Only the safety elements defined under this part are eligible for a safety approval.

## Subpart B—Application Procedures

### §414.9   Pre-application consultation.

The applicant must consult with the FAA before submitting an application. Unless the applicant or the FAA requests another form of consultation, consultation is oral discussion with the FAA about the application process and the potential issues relevant to the FAA's safety approval decision.

### §414.13   Confidentiality.

\(a\) To ensure confidentiality of data or information in the application, the applicant must—

\(1\) Send a written request with the application that trade secrets or proprietary commercial or financial data be treated as confidential, and include in the request the specific time frame confidential treatment is required.

\(2\) Mark data or information that require confidentiality with an identifying legend, such as “Proprietary Information,” “Proprietary Commercial Information,” “Trade Secret,” or “Confidential Treatment Requested.” Where this marking proves impracticable, attach a cover sheet that contains the identifying legend to the data or information for which confidential treatment is sought.

\(1\) The FAA accepts the application and will begin the reviews or evaluations required for a safety approval determination under this part.

\(2\) The FAA rejects the application because it is incomplete or indefinite making initiation of the reviews or evaluations required for a safety approval determination under this part inappropriate.

\(c\) The written notice will state the reason(s) for rejection and corrective actions necessary for the application to be accepted. The FAA may return a rejected application to the applicant or may hold it until the applicant provides more information.

\(d\) The applicant may withdraw, amend, or supplement an application anytime before the FAA makes a final determination on the safety approval application by making a written request to the Associate Administrator. If the applicant amends or supplements the initial application, the revised application must meet all the applicable requirements under this part.

### §414.17   Maintaining the continued accuracy of the initial application.

The applicant is responsible for the continuing accuracy and completeness of information provided to the FAA as part of the safety approval application. If at any time after submitting the application, circumstances occur that cause the information to no longer be accurate and complete in any material respect, the applicant must submit a written statement to the Associate Administrator explaining the circumstances and providing the new or corrected information. The revised application must meet all requirements under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/C Licensing/0414 Safety approvals#§414.11   Application.\|§414.11]].

## Subpart C—Safety Approval Review and Issuance

### §414.19   Technical criteria for reviewing a safety approval application.

\(a\) The FAA will determine whether a safety element is eligible for and may be issued a safety approval. We will base our determination on performance-based criteria, against which we may assess the effect on public health and safety and on safety of property, in the following hierarchy:

\(1\) FAA or other appropriate Federal regulations.

\(2\) Government-developed or adopted standards.

\(3\) Industry consensus performance-based criteria or standard.

\(4\) Applicant-developed criteria. Applicant-developed criteria are performance standards customized by the manufacturer that intends to produce the system, system component, or part. The applicant-developed criteria must define—

\(i\) Design and minimum performance;

The terms and conditions will include reporting requirements tailored to the individual safety approval.

\(d\) A safety approval is valid for five years and may be renewed.

\(e\) If the FAA denies the application, the applicant may correct any deficiency the FAA identified and request a reconsideration of the revised application. The applicant also has the right to appeal a denial as set forth in subpart D of this part.

### §414.23   Maintaining the continued accuracy of the safety approval application.

\(a\) The holder of a safety approval must ensure the continued accuracy and completeness of representations contained in the safety approval application, on which the approval was issued, for the entire term of the safety approval.

\(b\) If any representation contained in the application that is material to public health and safety or safety of property ceases to be accurate and complete, the safety approval holder must prepare and submit a revised application according to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/C Licensing/0414 Safety approvals#§414.11   Application.\|§414.11]] under this part. The safety approval holder must point out any part of the safety approval or the associated application that would be changed or affected by a proposed modification.

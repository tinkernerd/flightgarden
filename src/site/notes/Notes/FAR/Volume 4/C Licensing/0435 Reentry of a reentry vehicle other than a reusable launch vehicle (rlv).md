\(a\) *Reentry-specific license.* A reentry-specific license authorizes a licensee to reenter one model or type of reentry vehicle, other than an RLV, to a reentry site or other location approved for the reentry. A reentry-specific license may authorize more than one reentry and identifies each reentry authorized under the license. A licensee's authorization to reenter terminates upon completion of all activities authorized by the license or the expiration date stated in the reentry license, whichever occurs first.

\(b\) *Reentry-operator license.* A reentry operator license authorizes a licensee to reenter any of a designated family of reentry vehicles, other than an RLV, within authorized parameters, including trajectories, transporting specified classes of payloads to any reentry site designated in the license. A reentry operator license is valid for a 2-year renewable term.

### §435.5   Policy and safety approvals.

To obtain a reentry license, an applicant must obtain policy and safety approvals from the FAA. Requirements for obtaining these approvals are contained in subparts B and C of this part. Only a reentry license applicant may apply for the approvals, and may apply for either approval separately and in advance of submitting a complete license application, using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter.

### §435.7   Payload reentry determination.

\(a\) A payload reentry determination is required to transport a payload to Earth on a reentry vehicle unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload review.

\(b\) A payload reentry determination made under a previous license application under this subchapter may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

\(c\) The FAA conducts a review, as described in subpart D of this part, to make a payload reentry determination. Either a reentry license applicant or a payload owner or operator may request a review of the proposed payload using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter. Upon receipt of an application, the FAA may conduct a payload reentry review independently of a reentry license application.

### §435.8   Human space flight.

An applicant for a license to conduct a reentry with flight crew or a space flight participant on board the vehicle must demonstrate compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/C Licensing/0460 Human space flight requirements#§460.5   Crew qualifications and training.\|§§460.5]], 460.7, 460.11, 460.13, 460.15, 460.17, 460.51 and 460.53 of this subchapter.

### §435.9   Issuance of a reentry license.

\(a\) The FAA issues a reentry license to an applicant who has obtained all approvals and determinations required under this chapter for a reentry license.

\(b\) A reentry license authorizes a licensee to reenter a reentry vehicle and payload, if any, in accordance with the representations contained in the reentry licensee's application, subject to the licensee's compliance with terms and conditions contained in license orders accompanying the reentry license, including financial responsibility requirements.

### §435.11   Additional license terms and conditions.

The FAA may amend a reentry license at any time by modifying or adding license terms and conditions to ensure compliance with 51 U.S.C. Subtitle V, chapter 509, and applicable regulations.

\(a\) Only the FAA may transfer a reentry license.

\(b\) An applicant for transfer of a reentry license shall submit a reentry license application in accordance with part 413 of this subchapter and satisfy the applicable requirements of this part. The FAA will transfer a reentry license to an applicant who has obtained all of the approvals and determinations required under this chapter for a reentry license. In conducting its reviews and issuing approvals and determinations, the FAA may incorporate any findings made part of the record to support the initial licensing determination. The FAA may modify a reentry license to reflect any changes necessary as a result of a reentry license transfer.

### §435.15   Rights not conferred by reentry license.

Issuance of a reentry license does not relieve a licensee of its obligation to comply with requirements of law that may apply to its activities.

To obtain safety approval for reentry, an applicant must demonstrate the following for public risk:

\(a\) The risk to the collective members of the public from the proposed launch meets the public risk criteria of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety#§417.107   Flight safety.\|§417.107]](b)(1) of this chapter;

\(b\) The risk level to the collective members of the public, excluding persons in water-borne vessels and aircraft, from each proposed reentry does not exceed an expected number of 1 × 10−4 casualties from impacting inert and explosive debris and toxic release associated with the reentry; and

\(c\) The risk level to an individual does not exceed 1 × 10−6 probability of casualty per mission.

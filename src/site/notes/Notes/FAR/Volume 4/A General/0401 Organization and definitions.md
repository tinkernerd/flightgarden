\(2\) Is not on board the controlled vehicle.

*Reusable launch vehicle* (RLV) means a launch vehicle that is designed to return to Earth substantially intact and therefore may be launched more than one time or that contains vehicle stages that may be recovered by a launch operator for future use in the operation of a substantially similar launch vehicle.

*Risk* means a measure that accounts for both the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event and the consequence of that event to persons or property.

*Safety critical* means essential to safe performance or operation. A safety critical system, subsystem, component, condition, event, operation, process, or item is one whose proper recognition, control, performance, or tolerance is essential to ensuring public safety. Something that is safety critical item creates a safety hazard or provide protection from a safety hazard.

*Sigma* means a single standard deviation from a fixed value, such as a mean.

*Space flight participant* means an individual, who is not crew, carried aboard a launch vehicle or reentry vehicle.

*State and United States* means, when used in a geographical sense, the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and any other commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States; and

*Tether system* means a device that contains launch vehicle hazards by physically constraining a launch vehicle in flight to a specified range from its launch point. A tether system includes all components, from the tether's point of attachment to the vehicle to a solid base, that experience load during a tethered launch.

*United States citizen* means:

\(1\) Any individual who is a citizen of the United States;

\(2\) Any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, or other entity organized or existing under the laws of the United States or any State; and

\(3\) Any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, or other entity which is organized or exists under the laws of a foreign nation, if the controlling interest in such entity is held by an individual or entity described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition. *Controlling interest* means ownership of an amount of equity in such entity sufficient to direct management of the entity or to void transactions entered into by management. Ownership of at least fifty-one percent of the equity in an entity by persons described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition creates a rebuttable presumption that such interest is controlling.

*Validation* means an evaluation to determine that each safety measure derived from a system safety process is correct, complete, consistent, unambiguous, verifiable, and technically feasible. Validation ensures that the right safety measure is implemented, and that the safety measure is well understood.

*Vehicle safety operations personnel* means those persons whose job performance is critical to public health and safety or the safety of property during RLV or reentry operations.

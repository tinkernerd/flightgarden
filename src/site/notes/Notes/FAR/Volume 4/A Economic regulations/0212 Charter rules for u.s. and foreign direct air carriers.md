### §212.1   Scope.

This part applies to all charter flights, and all other flights carrying charter passengers or cargo, in interstate and/or foreign air transportation by U.S. certificated air carriers or in foreign air transportation by foreign air carriers. It does not apply to any flights performed by a commuter air carrier, air taxi operator, or certificated air carrier operating “small aircraft” under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0298 Exemptions for air taxi and commuter air carrier operations\|part 298 of this chapter]]. Nothing in this part gives authority to operate a type or level of service not authorized by certificate, foreign air carrier permit, or exemption, except that a certificated air carrier authorized to conduct scheduled operations may conduct charter flights, in interstate and/or foreign air transportation, without limitation as to the points served.

### §212.3   General provisions.

\(a\) Certificated and foreign air carriers may conduct charter flights as described in this part, and may carry charter passengers on scheduled flights, or charter cargo on scheduled or nonscheduled flights (or on the main deck or in the belly of passenger charter flights), subject to the requirements of this chapter and any orders of, or specific conditions imposed by, the Department.

\(b\) Charter flights may be operated on a round-trip or one-way basis, with no minimum group, shipment, or contract size.

\(c\) Contracts to perform charter flights must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the certificated or foreign air carrier and the charterer prior to the operation of the flights involved. The written agreement shall include:

\(1\) The name and address of either the surety whose bond secures advance charter payments received by the carrier, or of the carrier's depository bank to which checks or money orders for the advance charter payments are to be made payable as escrow holder pending completion of the charter trip; and

\(2\) A statement that unless the charterer files a claim with the carrier, or, if the carrier is unavailable, with the surety, within 60 days after the cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by the bond, the surety shall be released from all liability under the bond to such charterer for such trips.

\(d\) A certificated or foreign air carrier must make a reasonable effort to verify that any charterer with which it contracts, and any charter it conducts, meets the applicable requirements of this chapter.

\(e\) The certificated or foreign air carriers shall require full payment of the total charter price, including payment for the return portion of a round trip, or the posting of a satisfactory bond for full payment, prior to the commencement of any portion of the air transportation, *provided,* however, that in the case of a passenger charter for less than the entire of an aircraft, the carrier shall require full payment of the total charter price, including payment for the return portion of a round trip, from the charterers not less than 10 days prior to the commencement of any portion of the transportation, and such payment shall not be refundable unless the charter is canceled by the carrier or unless the carrier accepts a substitute charterer for one which has canceled a charter, in which case the amount paid by the latter shall be refunded. For the purpose of this section, payment to the carrier's depository bank, as designated in the charter contract, shall be deemed payment to the carrier.

\(f\) A certificated or foreign air carrier operating a U.S.-originating passenger charter shall be responsible to return to his or her point of origin any passenger who purchased round trip transportation on that charter and who was transported by that carrier on his or her outbound flight; except that this provision shall not apply in cases where the return transportation is to be provided by another certificated or foreign air carrier.

In addition, if a foreign air carrier is required to obtain a statement of authorization under paragraph (e) of that section, neither it, not any charter operator, or any other person shall advertise or sell any passenger charter services except those that have been specifically authorized by the Department.

\(h\) A certificated air carrier may not operate charters where such operations would result in a substantial change in the scope of its operations within the meaning of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0204 Data to support fitness determinations\|part 204 of this chapter]].

\(i\) A certificated air carrier may not limit its baggage liability for interstate charter flights except as set forth in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0254 Domestic baggage liability\|part 254 of this chapter]].

\(d\) “Bona fide members” are members of an organization who: Have not joined the organization merely to travel on a charter flight; and who have been members of the chartering organization for a minimum of six months prior to the date of commencement of the affected flight; *provided,* that the “six month” rule does not apply to:

\(1\) Employees of a single commercial establishment, industrial plant, or government agency, or

\(2\) Students and employees of a single school.

\(e\) The charter price due the direct air carrier shall be prorated equally among all the charter passengers, except that children under 12 may be offered discounted or free transportation.

### §212.7   Direct sales.

\(a\) Certificated and foreign air carriers may sell or offer for sale, and operate, as principal, Public Charter flights under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters\|part 380 of this chapter]] directly to the public.

\(b\) Each certificated or foreign air carrier operating a charter trip under this section shall comply with all the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0380 Public charters\|part 380 of this chapter]], except that:

\(ii\) If used in combination with a depository agreement, protect charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations and services) and assure the certificated or foreign air carrier's contractual and regulatory responsibilities to charter participants in the amount of at least \$10,000 times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more than \$200,000. The liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.

\(c\) The Department reserves the right to limit or prohibit the operation of direct sales Public Charters by a foreign air carrier upon a finding that such action is necessary in the public interest.

### §212.8   Protection of customers' payments.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no certificated air carrier or foreign air carrier shall perform any charter trip (other than a cargo charter trip) originating in the United States or any Overseas Military Personnel Charter trip, as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0372 Overseas military personnel charters\|part 372 of this chapter]], nor shall such carrier accept any advance payment in connection with any such charter trip, unless there is on file with the Department a copy of a currently effective agreement made between said carrier and a designated bank, by the terms of which all sums payable in advance to the carrier by charterers, in connection with any such trip to be performed by said carrier, shall be deposited with and maintained by the bank, as escrow holder, the agreement to be subject to the following conditions:

\(1\) The charterer (or its agent) shall pay the carrier either by check or money order made payable to the depository bank. Such check or money order and any cash received by the carrier from a charterer (or its agent) shall be deposited in, or mailed to, the bank no later than the close of the business day following the receipt of the check or money order or the cash, along with a statement showing the name and address of the charterer (or its agent); provided, however, that where the charter transportation to be performed by a carrier is sold through a travel agent, the agent may be authorized by the carrier to deduct its commission and remit the balance of the advance payment to the carrier either by check or money order made payable to the designated bank.

\(2\) The bank shall pay over to the carrier escrowed funds with respect to a specific charter only after the carrier has certified in writing to the bank that such charter has been completed; provided, however, that the bank may be required by the terms of the agreement to pay over to the carrier a specified portion of such escrowed funds, as payment for the performance of the outbound segment of a round-trip charter upon the carrier's written certification that such segment has been so completed.

\(3\) Refunds to a charterer from sums in the escrow account shall be paid directly to such charterer its assigns. Upon written certification from the carrier that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall turn over directly to the charterer or its assigns all escrowed sums (less any cancellation penalties as provided in the charter contract) which the bank holds with respect to such canceled charter, provided however, that in the case of a split charter escrowed funds shall be turned over to a charterer or its assigns only if the carrier's written certification of cancellation of such charter includes a specific representation that either the charter has been canceled by the carrier or, if the charter has been canceled by the charterer, that the carrier has accepted a substitute charterer.

\(4\) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter flight.

\(5\) As used in this section the term “bank” means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

\(b\) The escrow agreement required under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be effective until approved by the Department. Claims against the escrow may be made only with respect to the non-performance of air transportation.

\(c\) The carrier may elect, in lieu of furnishing an escrow agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to furnish and file with the Department a surety bond with guarantees to the United States Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of all overseas military personnel charter trips, as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0372 Overseas military personnel charters\|part 372 of this chapter]], to be performed, in whole or in part, by such carrier pursuant to any contracts entered into by such carrier. The amount of such bond shall be unlimited.1 Claims under the bond may be made only with respect to the non-performance of air transportation.

<div>

1While the face amount of the bond is unlimited, claims are limited to amounts that are paid to carrier for U.S.-originating passenger charter flights that carrier fails to perform or to refund.

</div>

\(d\) The bond permitted by this section shall be in the form set forth as the appendix to this part. Such bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company—

\(1\) Which is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of “A” or better or

\(2\) Which is listed in the U.S. Department of Treasury's notice listing companies holding Certificates of Authority as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies, published in the Federal Register on or about July 1. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which there is located the office or usual residence of the agency designated by the carrier under 49 U.S.C. 46103 to receive service of notices, process and other documents issued by or filed with the Department of Transportation. For the purposes of this section the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia. If the bond does not comply with the requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the Department will notify the certificated or foreign air carrier by registered or certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond. Unless such deficiencies are corrected within the time limit set forth in the notification, no amounts payable in advance by customers for the subject charter trips shall be accepted by the carrier.

\(e\) The bond required by this section shall provide that unless the charterer files a claim with the carrier, or, if the carrier is unavailable, with the surety, within 60 days after cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by the bond, the surety shall be released from all liability under the bond to such charterer for such charter trip. The contract between the carrier and the charterer shall contain notice of this provision.

### §212.9   Prior authorization requirements.

\(a\) Certificated air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization for each long-term wet lease to a foreign air carrier.

\(b\) Foreign air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization for each:

\(1\) Fifth-, sixth- and/or seventh-freedom charter flights to or from the United States;

\(2\) Long-term wet lease;

\(3\) Charter flight for which the Department specifically requires prior authorization under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section; or

\(4\) Part charter.

\(c\) The Department may issue blanket statements of authorization to foreign air carriers to conduct fifth freedom charters. The standards for issuing such blanket authorizations shall be those stated in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0212 Charter rules for u.s. and foreign direct air carriers#§212.11   Issuance of statement of authorization.\|§212.11]]. The Department may revoke any authority granted under this paragraph at any time without hearing.

\(d\) The Department may at any time, with or without hearing, but with at least 30 days' notice, require a foreign air carrier to obtain a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight. In deciding whether to impose such a requirement, the Department will consider (but not be limited to considering) whether the country of the carrier's nationality:

\(1\) Requires prior approval for third or fourth freedom charter flights by U.S. air carriers;

\(2\) Has, over the objection of the U.S. Government, denied rights of a U.S. air carrier guaranteed by a bilateral agreement; or

\(3\) Has otherwise impaired, limited, or denied the operating rights of U.S. air carriers, or engaged in unfair, discriminatory, or restrictive practices with respect to air transportation services to, from, through, or over its territory.

\(e\) The Department, in the interest of national security, may require a foreign air carrier to provide prior notification or to obtain a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight over U.S. territory.

\(5\) Where an application is required by more than one provision of this part and/or order of the Department, only one application need be filed, but it must conform to the earliest applicable filing deadline.

\(6\) The Department may require service of applications as it deems necessary.

(e)(1) Any person may file a memorandum supporting or opposing an application. Three copies of each memorandum shall be filed within 7 business days after service of the application or before the date of the proposed flight or flights, whichever is earlier. Memorandums will be considered to the extent practicable; the Department may act on an application without waiting for supporting or opposing memorandums to be filed.

\(2\) Each memorandum shall set forth the reasons why the application should be granted or denied, accompanied by whatever data, including affidavits, the Department is requested to consider.

\(3\) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the certified or foreign air carrier applying for approval.

\(2\) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in writing. If the Department finds that disclosure of all or part of the information would adversely affect the objecting person, and that the public interest does not require disclosure, it will order that the injurious information be withheld.

\[Doc. No. OST-97-2356, 63 FR 28236, May 22, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 3213, Jan. 21, 1999; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15925, Apr. 16, 2019\]

### §212.11   Issuance of statement of authorization.

\(a\) The Department will issue a statement of authorization if it finds that the proposed charter flight, part charter, or wet lease meets the requirements of this part and that it is in the public interest. Statements of authorization may be conditioned or limited.

\(b\) In determining the public interest the Department will consider (but not be limited to) the following factors:

\(1\) The extent to which the authority sought is covered by and consistent with bilateral agreements to which the United States is a party.

\(2\) The extent to which an applicant foreign air carrier's home country (and, in the case of a long-term wet lease, the lessee's home country) deals with U.S. air carriers on the basis of substantial reciprocity.

\(3\) Whether the applicant or its agent has previously violated the provisions of this part.

\(4\) Where the application concerns a long-term wet lease:

\(i\) Whether the lessor (applicant) or its agent or the lessee (charterer) or its agent has previously violated the provisions of the Department's charter regulations.

\(ii\) Whether, because of the nature of the arrangement and the benefits involved, the authority sought should be the subject of a bilateral agreement.

\(iii\) To what extent the lessor owns and/or controls the lessee, or is owned and/or controlled by the lessee.

\(c\) The Department will submit any denial of an authorization specifically required of a foreign air carrier under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0212 Charter rules for u.s. and foreign direct air carriers#§212.9   Prior authorization requirements.\|§212.9]](d) to the President of the United States at least 10 days before the proposed departure. The denial will be subject to stay or disapproval by the President within 10 days after it is submitted. A shorter period for Presidential review may be specified by the Department where the application for authorization is not timely or properly filed. Denial of a late-filed application need not be submitted to the President. For the purposes of this paragraph, an application filed by a foreign air carrier under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0212 Charter rules for u.s. and foreign direct air carriers#§212.9   Prior authorization requirements.\|§212.9]](d) to conduct a cargo charter will be considered as timely filed only if it is filed at least 30 calendar days before the proposed flight, notwithstanding the 10-day filing requirement for cargo charters in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0212 Charter rules for u.s. and foreign direct air carriers#§212.10   Application for statement of authorization.\|§212.10]](d)(3).

### §212.12   Waiver.

The Department may grant a waiver of any of the provisions of this part upon a finding that such waiver is in the public interest. A certificated or foreign air carrier may request a waiver by filing a written application with the Department, citing the specific provision to be waived and providing justification for such waiver.

### Appendix A to Part 212—Certificated or Foreign Air Carrier's Surety Bond Under Part 212 of the Regulations of the Department of Transportation ([[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0212 Charter rules for u.s. and foreign direct air carriers\|14 CFR Part 212]])

Know all persons by these presents, that we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Name of certificated or foreign air carrier) of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, (City) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (State or Country) as Principal (hereinafter called Principal), and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (name of Surety) a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in an unlimited amount, as required by 14 CFR 212.8, for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.

Whereas the principal, a certificated air carrier holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102, or a foreign air carrier holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 40109 authorizing that foreign air carrier to engage in charter trips in foreign air transportation, is subject to rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of charterers of civil aircraft and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will guarantee to the United States Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of all Overseas Military Personnel Charters, as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/D Special regulations/0372 Overseas military personnel charters\|14 CFR part 372]], to be performed, in whole or in part, by such certificated or foreign air carrier pursuant to contracts entered into by such carrier after the execution date of this bond, and

Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal with rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of charterer of civil aircraft for charter trips (other than cargo charters) originating in the United States or of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips and shall inure to the benefit of any and all such charterers to whom the Principal may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.

Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to such charterer any sum or sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill, and carry out all contracts made by the Principal while this bond is in effect for the performance of charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.

The liability of the Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder in any specified amount. The surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Department of Transportation forthwith of all suits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made by said Surety under this bond.

This bond is effective the \_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, 12:01 a.m., standard time at the address of the Principal as stated herein and shall continue in force until terminated as hereinafter provided. The Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice to the Department of Transportation at its office in Washington, D.C., such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after actual receipt of said notice by the Department. The Surety shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of the damages hereinbefore described which arise as the result of any contracts for the performance of air transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of this bond becomes effective, as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for the payment of any such damages arising as the result of contracts for the performance of air transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of this bond becomes effective. Liability of the Surety under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charterer who shall within sixty (60) days after the cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by this bond give written notice of claim to the certificated or foreign air carrier, or, if it is unavailable, to the Surety, and all liability on this bond for such charter trip shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination date thereof except for claims filed within the time provided herein.

In witness whereof, the said Principal and Surety have executed this instrument on the \_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_.

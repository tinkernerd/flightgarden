### §204.4   \[Reserved\]

### §204.5   Certificated and commuter air carriers undergoing or proposing to undergo substantial change in operations, ownership, or management.

\(a\) A certificated or commuter air carrier proposing a substantial change in operations, ownership or management shall file the data set forth in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0204 Data to support fitness determinations#§204.3   Applicants for new certificate or commuter air carrier authority.\|§204.3]]. These data must be submitted in cases where:

\(1\) The proposed change requires new or amended authority, or

\(2\) The change substantially alters the factors upon which its latest fitness finding is based, even if no new authority is required.

\(b\) Information which a carrier has previously formally filed with the Department, or with another Federal agency where they are available to the Department, which continues to reflect the current state of the carrier's fitness may be omitted. The carrier instead should identify the data and provide a citation for the date(s) and place(s) of filing. Prior to filing any data, the carrier may contact the Department (Air Carrier Fitness Division) to ascertain what data required by this section, if any, are already available to the Department or are not applicable to the substantial change in question and need not be included in the filing.

\(c\) Information filings pursuant to this section made to support an application for new or amended certificate authority shall be filed with the application and addressed to Docket Operations, M-30, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590, or by electronic submission at *http://www.regulations.gov*

### §204.6   Certificated and commuter air carriers proposing a change in operations, ownership, or management which is not substantial.

Carriers proposing to make a change which would not substantially affect their operations, management, or ownership, such as certificated carriers applying for additional authority which would not substantially change their operations, will be presumed to be fit and need not file any information relating to their fitness at time of the change. However, if the Department concludes, from its own analysis or based on information submitted by third parties, that such change may bring the carrier's fitness into question, the Department may require the applicant carrier to file additional information.

### §204.7   Revocation for dormancy.

\(a\) An air carrier that has not commenced any type of air transportation operations for which it was found fit, willing, and able within one year of the date of that finding, or an air carrier that, for any period of one year after the date of such a finding, has not provided any type of air transportation for which that kind of finding is required, is deemed no longer to continue to be fit to provide the air transportation for which it was found fit and, accordingly, its authority to provide such air transportation shall be revoked.

\(b\) An air carrier found fit which commences operations within one year after being found fit but then ceases operations, shall not resume operations without first filing all of the data required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0204 Data to support fitness determinations#§204.3   Applicants for new certificate or commuter air carrier authority.\|§204.3]] at least 45 days before it intends to provide any such air transportation. Such filings shall be addressed to the Docket Operations Office, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. The Department will entertain requests for exemption from this 45-day advance filing requirement for good cause shown. If there has been no change in fitness data previously formally filed with the Department, the carrier shall file a sworn statement to that effect signed by one of its officers. The carrier may contact the Department (Air Carrier Fitness Division) to ascertain which data are already available to the Department and need not be refiled. A carrier to which this paragraph applies shall not provide any air transportation for which it is required to be found fit, willing, and able until the Department decides that the carrier continues to be fit, willing, and able to perform such air transportation. During the pendency of the Department's consideration of a data submission under this paragraph, the expiration period set out in paragraph (a) of this section shall be stayed. If the decision or finding by the Department on the issue of the carrier's fitness is favorable, the date or that decision or finding shall be the date considered in applying paragraph (a) of this section.

\(c\) For purposes of this section, the date of a Department decision or finding shall be the service date of the Department's order containing such decision or finding, or, in cases where the Department's decision or finding is made by letter, the date of such letter.

\(d\) For purposes of this section, references to operations and to the providing of air transportation shall refer only to the actual performance of flight operations under an operating certificate issued to the carrier by the FAA.

This part establishes classifications of air carriers known as “air taxi operators” and “commuter air carriers,” provides certain exemptions to them from some of the economic regulatory provisions of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), specifies procedures by which such air carriers may obtain authority to conduct operations, and establishes rules applicable to their operations in interstate and/or foreign air transportation in all States, Territories and possessions of the United States. This part also establishes reporting requirements for commuter air carriers and small certificated air carriers.

### §298.2   Definitions.

As used in this part:

*Air taxi operator* means an air carrier as established by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0298 Exemptions for air taxi and commuter air carrier operations#§298.3   Classification.\|§298.3]](a).

*Air transportation* means interstate air transportation, foreign air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft as defined by the Statute.1

Note: Operations wholly within the geographic limits of a single State are not considered interstate air transportation if in those operations the carrier transports no more than a *de minimis* volume of passengers or property moving as part of a continuous journey to or from a point outside the State.

Foreign air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(23) of 49 U.S.C.

\(a\) A commuter air carrier that holds an effective Commuter Air Carrier Authorization and otherwise meets the requirements of this part is also authorized to conduct air taxi operations (e.g., scheduled cargo, mail under a U.S. Postal Service contract, on-demand passenger, on-demand cargo, or other service such as air ambulance operations, firefighting or seasonal operations) without having to meet the registration requirements of subpart C of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

\(b\) Should a commuter air carrier cease conducting all scheduled passenger operations and its Commuter Air Carrier Authorization is suspended pursuant to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0298 Exemptions for air taxi and commuter air carrier operations#§298.53   Suspension or revocation of authority.\|§§298.53]] and/or 204.7 of this chapter, it may continue to conduct air taxi operations *provided that* the carrier maintains in effect liability insurance coverage as required for such operations by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0205 Aircraft accident liability insurance\|part 205 of this chapter]] and, within 10 days of the cessation of scheduled passenger operations, registers as an air taxi operator in accordance with subpart C of this part; and *provided further* that the carrier continues to hold authority from the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct such air taxi operations.

### §298.53   Suspension or revocation of authority.

A Commuter Air Carrier Authorization may be suspended or revoked if any of the following occur:

\(a\) The operator fails to maintain insurance coverage as required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0205 Aircraft accident liability insurance\|part 205 of this chapter]] for commuter operations;

\(b\) The scheduled passenger authority under the operator's Air Carrier Certificate is suspended or revoked by the Federal Aviation Administration;

\(c\) The operator does not commence operations for which it has been found fit, or the operator ceases those operations as provided in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0204 Data to support fitness determinations#§204.7   Revocation for dormancy.\|§204.7]] of this chapter;

\(d\) The Department finds that the carrier is not fit, willing, and able to conduct scheduled service or fails to qualify as a citizen of the United States; or

\(e\) The Department determines that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.

## Subpart F—Reporting Requirements

### §298.60   General reporting instructions.

\(a\) Each commuter air carrier and each small certificated air carrier shall file with the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) the applicable schedules of BTS Form 298-C, “A Report of Financial and Operating Statistics for Small Aircraft Operators”, and Schedule T-100, “U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market”, as required by this section.

\(b\) A single copy of the BTS Form 298-C report shall be filed quarterly with the Office of Airline Information (OAI) for the periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year to be received on or before May 10, August 10, November 10, and February 10, respectively. An electronic filing of the monthly Schedule T-100 is due at OAI within 30 days after the end of each month. Due dates falling on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday will become effective on the next work day.

\(c\) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.

\[ER-1399, 50 FR 19, Jan. 2, 1985, as amended by Doc. No. 47939, 57 FR 40104, Sept. 2, 1992; 60 FR 66726, Dec. 26, 1995; 67 FR 49231, July 30, 2002; 75 FR 41585, July 16, 2010; DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15935, Apr. 16, 2019\]

### §298.61   Reporting of traffic statistics.

\(a\) Each commuter air carrier and small certificated air carrier shall file Schedule T-100, U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market.”

\(b\) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly as set forth in[[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0298 Exemptions for air taxi and commuter air carrier operations#§298.60   General reporting instructions.\|§298.60]].

\(1\) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data from revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. The first grouping, the nonstop segment information, is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.

\(2\) *Joint-service operations.* The Department may authorize joint service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.

\(i\) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.

\(ii\) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).

\(iii\) *Operational control.* The air carrier in operational control of the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority) must report joint-service operations.

\(c\) *Service classes.* (1) The statistical classifications are designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services are placed into service classes as follows:

<div>

<div>

<table data-border="1" data-cellpadding="1" data-cellspacing="1" data-frame="void" width="100%"><tbody><tr class="header"><th scope="col">Code</th><th scope="col">Type of Service</th></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">F</td><td style="text-align: left;">Scheduled Passenger/Cargo</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">G</td><td style="text-align: left;">Scheduled All-Cargo</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">L</td><td style="text-align: left;">Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">P</td><td style="text-align: left;">Nonscheduled Civilian Cargo</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">N</td><td style="text-align: left;">Nonscheduled Military Passenger/Cargo</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">R</td><td style="text-align: left;">Nonscheduled Military Cargo</td></tr></tbody></table>

</div>

</div>

\(2\) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first class, coach, and mixed passenger/cargo service.

\(3\) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.

\(d\) *Air transport traffic and capacity elements.* (1) Within each of the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment or market records as follows:

Airline employees, officers and directors, or other persons, except for ministers of religion, who are traveling under reduced-rate transportation authorized by 49 U.S.C. 41511(a) and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0223 Free and reduced-rate transportation\|14 CFR part 223]], as well as travel agents, cargo agents, and tour conductors traveling at reduced fares are also considered nonrevenue traffic.

*Traffic office.* A facility where air transportation is sold, and related processes of documentation and reservation confirmation are performed.

*Traffic, revenue.* Passengers and cargo transported by air for which remuneration is received by the air carrier. Airline employees, officers and directors, or other persons, except for ministers of religion, who are traveling under reduced-rate transportation authorized by 49 U.S.C. 41511(a) and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0223 Free and reduced-rate transportation\|14 CFR part 223]], travel agents, cargo agents, and tour conductors traveling at reduced fares, and other passengers and cargo carried for token service charges, are not considered as revenue traffic.

*Transportation, free.* The carriage of any person or cargo (other than cargo owned by the air carrier) without compensation.

*Unit basis* (*in depreciation accounting*). A plan under which depreciation expenses is accrued upon the basis of the book cost of the individual item of property in relation to the service life and salvage value of the particular item.

*Value, service.* The difference between the book cost and the residual value of property and equipment.

*Weight, allowable gross.* The maximum gross weight (of the aircraft and its contents) which an aircraft is licensed to carry into the air on each flight stage.

*Weight, average available.* The average capacity available for revenue traffic, determined by dividing available ton-miles by aircraft miles in revenue service.

*Weight, empty.* The weight of the airframe, engines, propellers, and fixed equipment of an aircraft. Empty weight excludes the weight of the crew and payload, but includes the weight of all fixed ballast, unusable fuel supply, undrainable oil, total quantity of engine coolant, and total quantity of hydraulic fluid.

*Weight, passenger.* For the purposes of this part, a standard weight of 200 pounds per passenger (including all baggage) is used for all civil operations and classes of service. Other weights may be prescribed in specific instances upon the initiative of the Department of Transportation or upon a factually supported request by an air carrier.

*Wet-Lease Agreement* means an agreement under which one carrier leases an aircraft with flight crew to another air carrier.

### Section 04   Air Carrier Groupings

<div>

\(a\) All large certificated air carriers are placed into three basic air carrier groupings based upon their level of operations and the nature of these operations. In order to determine the level of operations, total operating revenues for a twelve-month period are used. The following operating revenue ranges are used to establish air carrier groupings:

<div>

<div>

<table data-border="1" data-cellpadding="1" data-cellspacing="1" data-frame="void" width="100%"><tbody><tr class="header"><th scope="col">Carrier Group</th><th scope="col">Total Annual Operating Revenues</th></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">I</td><td style="text-align: left;">0-$100,000,000</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">II</td><td style="text-align: left;">$100,000,001-$1,000,000,000</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">III</td><td style="text-align: left;">$1,000,000,001 +</td></tr></tbody></table>

</div>

</div>

For reporting purposes, Group I air carriers are further divided into two subgroups: (1) Air carriers with total annual operating revenues from \$20,000,000 to \$100,000,000 and (2) Air carriers with total annual operating revenues below \$20,000,000.

\(b\) Both the criteria for establishing air carrier groupings and the assignment of each air carrier to a specific group of carriers will be reviewed periodically by the Director, Office of Airline Information, to assure the maintenance of appropriate standards for the grouping of carriers. When an air carrier's level of operations passes the upper or lower limit of its currently assigned carrier grouping, the carrier is not automatically transferred to a different group and a new level of reporting. The Office of Airline Information will issue an updated listing of the carrier groups on an annual basis. A carrier may petition for reconsideration of its assigned carrier grouping or request a waiver from the accounting and reporting requirements that are applicable to a particular group under the provisions of section 1-2 of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports.

### General Accounting Provisions

### Section 1   Introduction to System of Accounts and Reports

### Sec. 1-1   Applicability of system of accounts and reports.

Each large certificated air carrier shall keep its books of account, records and memoranda and make reports to the BTS in accordance with this system of accounts and reports. The BTS reserves the right, however, under the provisions of sections 49 U.S.C. 41701 and 41708, to expand or otherwise modify the classes of carriers subject to this system of accounts and reports.

\[ER-1400, 50 FR 11, Jan. 2, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 1-2   Waivers from this system of accounts and reports.

A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts or reports may be made by the BTS upon its own initiative or upon the submission of written request therefor from any air carrier, or group of air carriers, provided that such a waiver is in the public interest and each request for waiver expressly demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or technique; a specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in the provisions of this system of accounts and reports; and the application of such alternative procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive results as between air carriers.

\[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 1-3   General description of system of accounts and reports.

\(a\) This system of accounts and reports is designed to permit limited contraction or expansion to reflect the varying needs and capacities of different air carriers without impairing basic accounting comparability as between air carriers. In its administration three air carrier groups, designated Group I, Group II, and Group III, respectively (see section 04), are established by the BTS. This grouping will be reviewed from time to time upon petition of individual air carriers or by initiative of the BTS with the view of a possible regrouping of the air carriers.

\(b\) Under the system of accounts prescribed, balance sheet elements are accounted for by all air carrier groups within a fixed uniform pattern of specific accounts. All profit and loss elements are accounted for within specific objective accounts established for each air carrier group resulting from dual classifications, designated for each air carrier group, which are descriptive of both basic areas of financial activity, or functional operation, and objective served. The profit and loss elements of the three air carrier groups can be reduced to broad objectives and general or functional classifications which are comparable for all air carrier groups. Both balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and account groupings are designed, in general, to embrace all activities, both air transport and other than air transport, in which the air carrier engages and provide for the separation of elements identifiable exclusively with other than air transport activities. Profit and loss elements which are recorded during the current accounting year are subclassified as between (1) those which relate to the current accounting year and adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to prior accounting years, and (2) extraordinary items of material magnitude.

\(c\) In order to afford air carriers as much flexibility and freedom as possible in establishing ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet their individual needs, a minimum number of account subdivisions have been prescribed in this Uniform System of Accounts. It is intended, however, that each air carrier, in maintaining its accounting records, will provide subaccount and subsidiary account segregations of accounting elements which differ in nature of accounting characteristics, in a manner which will render individual elements readily discernible and traceable throughout the accounting system, and will provide for relating profit and loss elements to applicable balance sheet counterparts.

\[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 1-4   System of accounts coding.

\(a\) A four digit control number is assigned for each balance sheet and profit and loss account. Each balance sheet account is numbered sequentially, within blocks, designating basic balance sheet classifications. The first two digits of the four digit code assigned to each profit and loss account denote a detailed area of financial activity or functional operation. The first two digits, thus assigned to each profit and loss account, are numbered sequentially within blocks, designating more general classifications of financial activity and functional operation. The second two digits assigned to profit and loss accounts denote objective classifications.

\(b\) A fifth digit, appended as a decimal, has been assigned for internal control by the BTS of prescribed subdivisions of the primary objective balance sheet and profit and loss classifications. A different fifth digit code number from that assigned by the BTS may be adopted for internal recordkeeping by the air carrier provided the prescribed subclassification of objective accounts is not impaired and the code number assigned by the BTS is employed in reporting to the BTS on Form 41 Reports.

\[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 1-5   Records.

\(a\) The general books of account and all books, records, and memoranda which support in any way the entries therein shall be kept in such manner as to provide at any time full information relating to any account. The entries in each account shall be supported by such detailed information as will render certain the identification of all facts essential to a verification of the nature and character of each entry and its proper classification under the prescribed Uniform System of Accounts. Registers, or other appropriate records, shall be maintained of the history and nature of each note receivable and each note payable.

\(b\) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records such as organization tables and charts, internal accounting manuals and revisions thereto, minute books, stock books, reports, cost distributions and other accounting work sheets, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may constitute necessary links in developing the history of, or facts regarding, any accounting or financial transaction.

\(c\) All books, records and memoranda shall be preserved and filed in such manner as to readily permit the audit and examination thereof by representatives of the DOT. All books, records, and memoranda shall be housed or stored in such manner as to afford protection from loss, theft, or damage by fire, flood or otherwise and no such books and records shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except in conformance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0249 Preservation of air carrier records\|14 CFR part 249]] for the preservation of records.

\[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 1-6   Accounting entities.

\(a\) Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each air transport entity for which separate reports to the BTS are required to be made by sections 21(g) and for each separate corporate or organizational division of the air carrier. For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, each nontransport entity conducting an activity which is not related to the air carrier's transport activities and each transport-related activity or group of activities qualifying as a nontransport venture pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, whether or not formally organized within a distinct organizational unit, shall be treated as a separately operated organizational division; except that provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (b) shall not apply to leasing activities.

\(b\) As a general rule, any activity or group of activities comprising a transport-related service provided for in transport-related revenue and expense accounts 09 through 18 shall be considered a separate nontransport venture under circumstances in which either: (1) A separate corporate or legal entity has been established to perform such services, (2) the aggregate annual revenue rate, as determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater of \$1 million per annum or one percent of the air carrier's total annual transport revenues, or (3) the aggregate annual expense rate, as determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater of \$1 million or one percent of the carrier's total annual operating expenses: *Provided,* That revenues and expenses from in-flight sales, and interchange sales shall be considered related to air transportation and accounted for accordingly, regardless of the revenue or expense standard set forth above.

\(c\) The records for each required accounting entity shall be maintained with sufficient particularity to permit a determination that the requirements of section 2-1 have been complied with.

\[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended by ER-841, 39 FR 11994, Apr. 2, 1974; ER-1022, 42 FR 46495, Sept. 15, 1977; ER-1027, 42 FR 60127, Nov. 25, 1977; 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 1-7   Interpretation of accounts.

To the end that uniform accounting may be maintained, questions involving matters of accounting significance which are not clearly provided for should be submitted to the Director, Office of Airline Information, K-25, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, for explanation, interpretation, or resolution.

\[Amdt. 241-58, 54 FR 5591, Feb. 6, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 1-8   Address for reports and correspondence.

Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.

\[Doc. No. OST-2006-26053, 75 FR 41583, July 16, 2010\]

### Section 2   General Accounting Policies

### Sec. 2-1   Generally accepted accounting principles.

\(a\) The accounting provisions contained in this part are based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Persons subject to this part are authorized to implement, as prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, newly issued GAAP pronouncements until and unless the Director, Office of Airline Information (OAI), issues an Accounting Directive making an initial determination that implementation of a new pronouncement would adversely affect the Department's programs.

\(b\) The Director, OAI, shall review each newly issued GAAP pronouncement to determine its affect on the Department's regulatory programs. If adopting a specific change in GAAP would adversely affect the Department's programs, the Director will issue the results of the review in the form of an Accounting Directive. The directive will state the reasons why the particular change should not be incorporated in the uniform system of accounts and contain accounting guidance for maintaining the integrity of the Department's air carrier accounting provisions.

\(c\) Objections and comments relating to the Department's decision not to implement a change in generally accepted principles may be addressed to Director, Office of Airline Information, K-25, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. If significant objections are raised urging adoption of a particular GAAP pronouncement, the Department will institute a rulemaking.

\[\[Amdt. 241-58, 54 FR 5592, Feb. 6, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995\]

### Sec. 2-2   Basis of allocation between entities.

\(a\) The provisions of this section shall apply to each person controlling an air carrier, each person controlled by the air carrier, as well as each transport entity and organizational division of the air carrier for which separate records must be maintained pursuant to section 1-6.

\(b\) Each transaction shall be recorded and placed initially under accounting controls of the particular air transport entity or organizational division of the air carrier or member of an affiliated group to which directly traceable. If applicable to two or more accounting entities, a proration shall be made from the entity of original recording to other participating entities on such basis that the statements of financial condition and operating results of each entity are comparable to those of distinct legal entities. The allocations involved shall include all debits and credits associated with each entity.

\(c\) For purposes of this section, investments by the air carrier in resources or facilities used in common by the regulated air carrier and those transport-related revenue services defined as separate nontransport ventures under section 1-6(b) shall not be allocated between such entities but shall be reflected in total in the appropriate accounts of the entity which predominately uses those investments. Where the entity of predominate use is a nontransport venture, the air carrier shall reflect the investment in account 1510.3, Advances to Associated Companies.

\(d\) For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, all revenues shall be assigned to or apportioned between accounting entities on bases which will fully recognize the services provided by each entity, and expenses, or costs, shall be apportioned between accounting entities on such bases as will result: (1) With respect to transport-related services, in the assignment thereto of proportionate direct overheads, as well as direct labor and materials, of the applicable expense functions prescribed by this system of accounts and reports, and (2) with respect to separate ventures, in the assignment thereto of proportional general and administrative overheads as well as the direct overheads, labor, and materials.

### Sec. 2-3   Distribution of revenues and expenses within entities.

\(a\) Revenues and expenses attributable to a single natural objective account or functional classification shall be assigned accordingly.

\(b\) Revenue and expense items which are common to two or more natural objective accounts shall be recorded in the objective accounts to which they predominantly relate.

\(c\) Expense items contributing to more than one function shall be charged to the general overhead functions to which applicable except that where only incidental contribution is made to more than a single function an item may be included in the function to which primarily related, provided such function is not distorted by including an aggregation of amounts applicable to other functions. When assignment of expense items on the basis of the primary activity to which related does not in the aggregate result in a fair presentation of the expenses applicable to each function, apportionment shall be made between functions based upon a study of the contribution to each function during a representative period.

\[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972. Redesignated by Amdt. 241-58, 54 FR 5592, Feb. 6, 1989\]

### Sec. 2-4   Accounting period.

\(a\) The accounting year of each air carrier subject to this Uniform System of Accounts shall be the calendar year unless otherwise approved by the BTS.

\(b\) Each air carrier shall keep its financial accounts and records on a full accrual basis for each quarter so that all transactions, as nearly as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be fully reflected in the air carrier's books for the quarter in which revenues have been earned and the costs attaching to the revenues so earned in each quarter have been incurred independently of the incidence of sales or purchases and settlement with debtors or creditors.

\(c\) Expenditures incurred during the current accounting year which demonstrably benefit operations to be performed during subsequent accounting years to a significant extent shall be deferred and amortized to the period in which the related operations are performed when of sufficient magnitude to distort the accounting results of the year in which incurred.

\(d\) Expenditures charged directly or amortized to operations within one accounting year shall not be reversed in a subsequent accounting year and reamortized or charged directly against operations of subsequent years except that retroactive adjustments are permitted where necessary to conform with adjustments required by the DOT for ratemaking purposes.

##### 1290   Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.

\(a\) Record here accruals for estimated losses from uncollectible accounts.

\(b\) All accounts against which allowances have been established shall be examined quarterly for the purpose of redetermining the basis of accruals to be applied to subsequent accounting periods and the reasonableness of allowances already provided.

##### 1300   Spare parts and supplies.

\(a\) Record here the cost of:

\(1\) Flight equipment replacement parts of a type which ordinarily would be recurrently expended and replaced rather than repaired and reused;

\(2\) Unissued fuel inventories for use in the overall or system operations of the carrier. Adjustments of inventories for aircraft fuel due to retroactive price increases and decreases shall not be entered in this account but in profit and loss account 45, Aircraft Fuels and Oils; and

\(3\) Unissued and unapplied materials and supplies held in stock such as unissued shop materials, expendable tools, stationery and office supplies, passenger service supplies, and restaurant and food service supplies.

\(b\) Costs paid by the air carrier such as transportation charges and customs duties; excise, sales, use and other taxes; special insurance; and other charges applicable to the cost of spare parts and supplies shall be charged to this account when they can be definitely allocated to specific items or units of property. If such costs cannot be so allocated, or if of minor significance in relation to the cost of such property, such amounts may be charged to balance sheet account 1890 Other Assets and Deferred Charges and cleared either by a suitable “loading charge” as the parts are used or by current charges to appropriate expense or property accounts; so long as the method of application does not cause material distortion in operating expenses from one accounting period to another.

\(c\) Reusable spare parts and supplies recovered in connection with construction, maintenance, or retirement of property and equipment shall be included in this account at fair and reasonable values but in no case shall such values exceed original cost. Recoveries of normally reparable and reusable parts of a type for which losses in value may be covered on a practical basis through valuation allowance provisions shall be included in this account on an original cost basis. Scrap and nonusable parts, expensed from this account and recovered, shall be included at net amounts realizable therefrom with contra credit to the expense accounts initially charged.

\(d\) The cost of rotable parts and assemblies of material value included in this account which ordinarily are repaired and reused and possess a service life approximating that of the primary property types to which related shall not be recorded in this account but in balance sheet account 1608 Flight Equipment Rotable Parts and Assemblies. For purposes of identifying rotable parts and assemblies of insignificant unit value which may be included in this account, a reasonable maximum unit value limitation may be established.

\(e\) Any losses sustained or gains realized upon the abandonment or other disposition of flight equipment expendable parts shall be taken up as capital gains or losses in the periods in which sustained or realized. (See balance sheet account 1311.)

\(f\) Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense accounts as issued for use. Profit and loss on sales of inventory items as a routine service to others shall be included in profit and loss accounts 14 General Service Sales—Associated Companies, or 16 General Service Sales—Outside, and the parts sold shall be removed from this accounts at full cost.

\(g\) Materials and supplies held in small supply and purchased currently may be charged to appropriate expense accounts when purchased.

\(h\) An allowance for inventory adjustment applicable to materials and supplies is prohibited. Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense accounts as issued for use.

\(i\) Subaccounts shall be established within this account for the separate recording of each class or type of spare parts and supplies.

\[ER-980, 42 FR 29, Jan. 3, 1977, as amended by ER-1401, 50 FR 241, Jan. 3, 1985\]

##### 1311   Allowance for Obsolescence—Spare Parts and Supplies.

\(a\) Accruals shall be made to this account when allowances are established for losses in the value of expendable parts. The accruals to this account shall be made by charges to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts. Records shall be maintained with sufficient detail to permit association of the allowances with each class or type of expendable parts.

\(b\) The accruals to this account shall be based upon a predetermination by the air carrier of that portion of the total inventory of each class and type of expendable parts against which an allowance for loss is to be accrued. Expendable parts issued for use in operations shall be charged to operating expenses as issued and shall not be charged to this account. If at the end of any calendar year the amount of the allowance exceeds the product of the applicable inventory for the year determined consistently on a year-end or average basis, and the sum of the standard percentage accrual rates for all prior years including the current, the allowance shall be adjusted downward by the amount of the excess. Such adjustments shall be charged to this account and credited to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts.

\(c\) Where changing conditions necessitate a revision or adjustment in rates of accrual, such revision or adjustment shall be made applicable to current and subsequent accounting periods and shall not be applied retroactively to prior accounting periods. Following retirement of airframe or aircraft engine types to which related, any balance remaining in this account shall be offset against related balances carried in balance sheet account 1300 Spare Parts and Supplies and the net cleared to profit and loss accounts 88.5 Capital Gains and Losses—Operating Property or 88.6 Capital Gains and Losses—Other.

\[ER-980, 42 FR 29, Jan. 3, 1977, as amended by ER-1401, 50 FR 241, Jan. 3, 1985\]

### Section 8   General

\(a\) The profit and loss accounts are designed to reflect, through natural groupings, the elements entering into the derivation of income or loss accruing to the proprietary interests during each accounting period.

\(b\) The prescribed system of accounts provides for the co-ordinate grouping of all revenues and expenses in terms of both major natural objectives and functional activities and for subdivision of both to provide varying degrees of detail for air carriers of differing accounting capacities and/or requirements.

\(c\) The detailed objective accounts established for each air carrier group, by the dual subdivision of profit and loss elements in terms of both natural objectives and functional activities, are set forth in section 7, Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts.

\(d\) The prescribed system of accounts provides generally that profit and loss elements shall be grouped in accordance with their inherent characteristics within the following primary classifications:

\(1\) *Operating revenues.* (i) This primary classification shall include revenues of a character usually and ordinarily derived from the performance of air transportation and air transportation-related services, which relate to services performed during the current accounting year, and adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to services performed in prior accounting years.

\(ii\) Operating revenues shall be subclassified in terms of functional activities as provided in section 9.

\(2\) *Operating expenses.* (i) This primary classification shall include expenses of a character usually and ordinarily incurred in the performance of air transportation and air transportation-related services, which relate to services performed during the current accounting year, and adjustments of a recurring nature attributable to services performed in prior accounting years.

\(ii\) Operating expenses shall be subclassified in terms of functional activities as provided in sections 10 and 11.

\(3\) *Nonoperating income and expense—net.* This primary classification (8100) shall include income and loss incident to commercial ventures not inherently related to the performance of the common carrier air transport services of the accounting entity; other revenues and expenses attributable to financing or other activities which are extraneous to and not an integral part of air transportation or its incidental services; and special recurrent items of a nonperiod nature.

\(4\) *Income taxes for current period.* This primary classification (9100) shall include provisions for Federal, state, local, and foreign taxes which are based upon the net income of the air carrier for the current period together with refunds for excess profits credits or carryback of losses and increases or reductions of income taxes of prior years of a magnitude which will not distort net income of the current accounting year. Income taxes applicable to special income credits or debits recorded in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary Items, and other material income tax items not allocable to income of the current accounting year, shall not be included in this classification but in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary Items.

\(5\) *Discontinued operations.* This primary classification (9600) shall include earnings and losses of discontinued nontransport operations and gains or losses from the disposal of nontransport operations the result of which are customarily accounted for through profit and loss objective accounts 86, 87 and 88.2.

\(6\) *Extraordinary items.* This primary classification (9700) shall include material items characterized by their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence.

\(7\) *Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.* This primary classification (9800) shall include the cumulative effect of material changes in accounting principles.

\(e\) Each Group I air carrier shall maintain the following subfunctions:

<div>

### 5200   *Direct Maintenance.*

a\. This subfunction shall include the costs of labor, materials and outside services consumed directly in periodic maintenance operations and the maintenance and repair of property and equipment, of all types and classes, regardless of the location at which incurred, exclusive of costs specifically identified with maintenance property and equipment expenses in balance sheet accounts 1630 Equipment, 1639 Improvements to Leased Buildings and Equipment, and 1640.1 Maintenance Buildings and Improvements which shall be included in subfunction 5300 Maintenance Burden.

b\. The cost of direct labor, materials and supplies, as well as outside repairs, used in the maintenance and repair of property and equipment shall be recorded on running job orders or tickets covering repairs and periodic inspections except servicing. Where a number of like items are maintained on a group basis, it will be necessary to maintain only one job order for each group.

c\. When supervisory personnel such as crew chiefs, inspectors and foremen are engaged in direct labor in connection with equipment maintenance, a proportionate part of their salaries and wages shall be charged to the appropriate direct labor accounts. The cost of transporting property to and from shops for repair and maintenance shall be included as a part of the cost of the materials and supplies used in the repair or maintenance of such property and equipment. Transportation charges, customs and duties, etc.; shall be included in the cost of repairs and maintenance operations when made by outside parties.

### 5300   *Maintenance Burden.*

a\. This subfunction shall include all overhead or general expenses which are specifically identified with activities involved in periodic maintenance operations and the maintenance and repair of property and equipment of all types and classes, including the cost of direct labor, materials and outside services identified with the maintenance and repair of maintenance property and equipment included in balance sheet accounts 1630 Equipment, 1639 Improvements to Leased Buildings and Equipment, and 1604.1 Maintenance Buildings and Improvements.

c\. This subfunction shall include only those expenses attributable to the current air transport operations of the air carrier. Maintenance burden associated with capital projects of the air carrier, other than overhauls of airframes and aircraft engines shall be allocated to such projects. Maintenance burden incurred in common with services to other companies and operating entities shall be allocated to such services on a pro rata basis unless the services are so infrequent in performance or small in volume as to result in no appreciable demands upon the air carrier's maintenance facilities. When overhauls of airframes or aircraft engines are as a consistent practice accounted for on an accrual basis instead of being expensed directly, maintenance burden shall be allocated to such overhauls on a pro rata basis. Standard burden rates may be employed for quarterly allocations of maintenance burden provided the rates are reviewed at the close of each calendar year. When the actual burden rate for the year differs materially from the standard burden rate applied, adjustment shall be made to reflect the actual cost incurred for the full accounting year. Allocations of maintenance burden to capital projects, and service sales to others shall be made through the individual maintenance burden objective accounts, except that the air carrier may make such allocations by credits to profit and loss account 77 Uncleared Expense Credits provided that use of that account will not undermine the significance of the individual maintenance burden objective accounts in terms of the expense levels associated with the air carrier's air transport services. Maintenance burden allocated to overhauls shall be credited to profit and loss subaccounts 5372.1 or 5372.6 Airworthiness Allowance Provisions.

\(27\) *650 Total aircraft hours (airborne).* The elapsed time, computed from the moment the aircraft leaves the ground until it touches down at the next landing. This includes flight training, testing, and ferry flights.

\(28\) *810 Aircraft days assigned to service—carrier's equipment.* The number of days that aircraft owned or acquired through rental or lease (but not interchange) are in the possession of the reporting air carrier and are available for service on the reporting carrier's routes plus the number of days such aircraft are in service on routes of others under interchange agreements. Includes days in overhaul, or temporarily out of service due to schedule cancellations. Excludes days that newly acquired aircraft are on hand, but not available for productive use, days rented or leased to others (for other than interchange) and days in possession but formally withdrawn from air transportation service.

\(29\) *820 Aircraft days assigned to service—carrier's routes.* The same as “aircraft days assigned to service—carrier's equipment,” but excluding the number of days that the reporting carrier's owned or rented equipment are in the possession of others under interchange agreements and including the number of days aircraft of others are in the possession of the reporting air carrier under interchange agreements.

\(30\) *921 Aircraft fuels issued (gallons).* The amount of aircraft fuels issued, in U.S. gallons, during the reporting period for both revenue and nonrevenue flights.

### Sec. 19-7   Passenger origin-destination survey.

\(a\) All U.S. large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled passenger operations (except helicopter carriers) shall participate in a Passenger Origin-Destination (O & D) Survey covering domestic and international operations, as described in the instructions manual entitled, *Instructions to Air Carriers for Collecting and Reporting Passenger Origin-Destination Survey Statistics* (Appendix A to this section), and in *Passenger Origin-Destination Directives* issued by the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), Office of Airline Information (OAI). Copies of these *Instructions* and *Directives* are provided to each large carrier participating in the Survey. Copies are also available from the Office of Airline Information, RTS-42, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. Copies of these *Instructions* and *Directives* are available on the BTS Web page at (*http://www.bts.gov/programs/airline\_\_information/*).

\(b\) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.

\(c\) A statistically valid sample of light coupons shall be selected for reporting purposes. The sample shall consist of at least 1 percent of the total lifted ticket flight coupons for all large domestic markets listed in the Instructions and 10 percent for all others—including domestic and international markets. The sample shall be selected and reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of their section, except that the participating O & D carriers with nonstandard ticketing procedures, or other special operating characteristics, may propose alternative procedures. Such departures from standard O & D Survey practices shall not be authorized unless approved in writing by the Director, Office of Airline Information under the procedures in Sec. 1-2 of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0241 Uniform system of accounts and reports for large certificated air carriers\|14 CFR part 241]]. The data to be recorded and reported from selected lifted ticket flight coupons, as stipulated in the *Instructions* and *Directives* shall include the following data elements: Point of origin, carrier on each flight-coupon stage, fare-basis code for each flight-coupon stage, points of stopover or connection (interline and intraline), point of destination, number of passengers, and total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax).

\(d\) Data covering the operations of foreign air carriers that are similar to the information collected in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey are generally not available to the Department, the U.S. carriers, or U.S. interests. Therefore, because of the damaging competitive impact on U.S. carriers and the adverse effect upon the public interest that would result from unilateral disclosure of the U.S. survey data, the Department has determined its policy to be that the international data in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey shall be disclosed only as follows:

\(1\) To an air carrier directly participating in and contributing input data to the Survey or to a legal or consulting firm designated by an air carrier to use on its behalf O & D data in connection with a specific assignment by such carrier.

\(2\) To parties to any proceeding before the Department to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the Administrative Law Judge or by the Department's decision-maker. Any data to which access is granted pursuant to this section may be introduced into evidence subject to the normal rules of admissability of evidence.

\(3\) To agencies and other components of the U.S. Government.

\(4\) To other persons upon a showing that the release of the data will serve specifically identified needs of U.S. users which are consistent with U.S. interests.

\(5\) To foreign governments and foreign users as provided in formal reciprocal arrangements between the foreign and U.S. governments for the exchange of comparable O & D data.

\(e\) The Department reserves the right to make such other disclosures of the O & D data as is consistent with its regulatory functions and responsibilities.

## B. Narrative Description

A single O&D Survey is conducted continuously by the large U.S. certificated air carriers. Foreign air carriers do not directly participate in the Survey, although some of their data are captured in the Survey, since passengers who share a ticketed itinerary between a U.S. carrier and a foreign carrier may be sampled by the U.S. carrier. The authority for these instructions is found in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0241 Uniform system of accounts and reports for large certificated air carriers\|14 CFR part 241]], sec. 19-7.

The Survey samples revenue passenger trips moving in whole or in part on domestic and/or international scheduled services of the carriers participating in the Survey. In general, these requirements do not apply to small certificated, all-cargo and all charter carriers.

The source documents for the Survey data are passenger tickets. These data are collected from the “lifted” flight coupons of tickets (a portion of a multi-part ticket booklet of three1 or more coupons, including one for each stage of the passenger's trip itinerary which is lifted by the carrier as the passenger boards a particular flight segment).

<div>

1Each ticket booklet is comprised of one or more *flight coupons* for passenger travel in a city-pair market, plus a *passenger coupon* (the traveler's receipt) and the *auditor coupon* (for the carrier's internal controls).

</div>

The Survey data are taken from the coupon that is lifted by a participating carrier, unless it is apparent from the lifted coupon that another participating carrier has already recorded and reported the data, in which instance the ticket coupon is non-reportable for the second honoring/participating carrier. The complete passenger itinerary, and related data on type of fare and dollar value of the ticket, is recorded as one entry from the sampled, reportable flight coupon.

The recording of data from the sampled flight coupon normally consists of transcribing the information exactly as indicated on the ticket. The detail recorded for each trip shows the complete routing from the origin city (airport code) to the destination city (airport code) including, in sequence from the origin, each point of transfer and stopover (intraline and interline), the summarized fare-basis code shown for each flight coupon stage of the itinerary, and the total dollar value of the fare and tax for the entire ticket.

Prior to 1987, the Survey was generally based on a 10-percent sample of passenger tickets. Beginning July 1, 1987, the Survey is collected primarily on the basis of a stratified, scientific sample of at least 1 percent of tickets in domestic major markets and 10 percent of tickets in all other domestic and in all international city-pair markets. The Survey data are taken from the selected flight coupons of the tickets sampled: single-coupon or double-coupon round trips in domestic major markets where the ticket serial number ends in double zero (00) and all other ticket coupons ending in zero (0). This procedure yields a “two-tiered” stratified sample.

Group tickets are included on the basis of a 10-percent sample when the number of passengers on such a group ticket is 10 or less. Group tickets with more than 10 passengers on each ticket are included on the basis of a 100 percent census, *i.e.,* all such tickets are sampled, regardless of serial number, and the total data listed are conformed to a 10 percent sample for inclusion in the O&D Survey.

Following the selection of reportable flight coupons and the recording of data, each participating carrier shall edit and summarize2 the data into a quarterly report to the Department.

<div>

2These summarization procedures include showing two or more passengers with the same itinerary as one O&D record and compressing extremely lengthy itineraries (such as around-the-world tickets) into a standard trip stage length limit (which may be either seven or twenty-three stages, at the carrier's option), as explained in Section V.D.

</div>

# II. Effective Date of Instructions

These data collection and reporting instructions are effective on and after July 1, 1987 and apply to all flight coupons lifted on or after July 1, 1987.

# III. Carriers Participating in Survey

A. *Participating carriers.* As defined in section 19-7 of the Department's Economic Regulations ([[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0241 Uniform system of accounts and reports for large certificated air carriers\|14 CFR part 241]]), the participants in the O&D Survey include all large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled passenger services (except helicopter carriers). These participating carriers collect and report data in accordance with these Instructions, and supplemental *Passenger Origin-Destination Directives* that may be issued periodically. The list of participating carriers will be issued by reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27(b).

B. *Amendments to list of participating carriers.* As new carriers begin service, they will be required to file O&D Survey Data. These carriers will not be added to the participating carrier list automatically, but will be added when the next annual review is made.

# IV. Submission of Reports

A. *Period covered by reports.* Reports are to be filed for each calendar quarter of the year as shown below:

</div>

C. *Format of the Report.* Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.

D. \[Reserved\]

E. All reports shall be filed with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.

# V. Selection of Sample and Recording of Data.4

<div>

4Upon approval of the Director, Office of Airline Information, carriers may continue current reporting procedures (up to twenty-three stages of a passenger flight) and may report a uniform 10 percent sample of tickets lifted (each zero ending lifted coupon) without reducing the sample size from 10 percent to 1 percent for domestic major markets. Note that the domestic major markets will be reviewed each year at June 30, based on the prior 12 months O&D data, and the list amended as necessary. The list could remain static for more than a year, although it will be reviewed annually. Necessary amendments will be effective on January 1 of the following year.

</div>

A. *Sampling Basis.* Each participating carrier in this O&D Survey shall search all listed flight coupons, whether the coupons are its own ticket stock or on the ticket stock of another U.S. or foreign carrier (either standard IATA and ARC ticket stock or nonstandard ticket stock), and is to *select for reporting purposes* the following flight coupons:

\(1\) *Major domestic markets.* All single-passenger flight coupons that are either a single flight coupon ticket or part of a round trip, two coupon ticket where the ticket serial number ends in the digits double-zero (00).

<div>

Note. The list of major domestic markets will be issued by reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27(b).

</div>

\(2\) *International markets and all other domestic markets.* (a) All single-passenger flight coupons with ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0);

\(b\) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 10 or fewer passengers with ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0);

\(c\) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 11 or more passengers without regard to serial number; and

\(d\) Itineraries in major domestic markets that comprise more than two coupons are sampled on a uniform 10 percent basis, by selecting all ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0).

B. *Selection of Reportable Flight Coupons.* The flight coupons identified above are to be examined to isolate the reportable flight coupons, i.e. coupons from which data are to be recorded. Flight coupon data are reported only by the first honoring and participating carrier (operating carrier). Such carriers shall report the required data for the entire ticketed itinerary.

If a participating carrier has preceded an examining carrier on any stage in the trip itinerary, including any stage in a conjunction itinerary and any stage in a reissued ticket (either before or after reissue) that coupon is not reportable.

For conjunction tickets, the ticket number for the first ticket booklet determines if the conjunction tickets should be reported in the Survey. Otherwise, conjunction tickets do not require special treatment and are governed by the rules for regular tickets.

No adjustment is made in the Survey for alterations or changes in the trip itinerary subsequent to the stage covered by the reportable coupon.

C. *Optional Use of Other Sampling Procedures.*

\(1\) Alternative sampling procedures or alternative O&D data systems may be proposed by participating carriers with nonstandard ticketing procedures, or other special operating characteristics. Data reported under proposed alternative procedures must approximate the usefulness and statistical validity of the O&D Survey.

\(2\) Such departures from the prescribed O&D Survey practices shall not be authorized unless approved in writing by the Director, Office of Airline Information (address inside front cover). The proposed alternative O&D Survey procedures must be described in detail in the letter requesting the waiver.

D. *Recording of Data from Reportable Flight Coupons.* (1) The following items are to be reported from the reportable flight coupons:

\(a\) Point of origin,

\(b\) Operating carrier on each flight stage (if unknown, identify ticketed carrier),

\(c\) Ticketed carrier on each flight stage,

\(d\) Fare-basis on each flight coupon, C, D, F, G, X or Y,

\(e\) Points of stopover or connection (interline and intraline),

\(f\) Point of destination,

\(g\) Number of passengers, and

\(h\) Total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax and other charges, such as Passenger Facility Charges).

\(2\) The individual items are to be recorded in the sequence of occurrence in the itinerary as follows:

\(a\) All entries for *points* (airport codes5) in an itinerary are to be recorded in three-letter airport code data to fit into the stage-length limitation (seven or twenty-three stages at the carrier's option), all airport codes are to be reported, including data on commuter, foreign, intra-state and other carriers' portions of itineraries. Normally codes are recorded as they appear on the ticket. However, if a code is obviously incorrect, *record the correct code.* For instance, if a ticket is coded DCA-NYC or Washington/National to New York when the flight stage actually operated from Washington, Dulles to Newark (EWR), record the correct airport code. When only name spellings of a city appear on the ticket for multi-airport cities (such as Washington, New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles), record the specific *three letter airport code.* In cases where two airport codes are shown on the ticket for a point, such as when the passenger arrives at an airport such as San Francisco and departs from another local airport such as Oakland, record the code for the arrival airport, enter a surface segment indicator (—) to the departure airport, and record the departure airport code. (When the surface portion is at the beginning or end of an itinerary, the surface indicator is to be omitted). For example:

<div>

5Codes to be used are those appearing in the *Official Airline Guide* at the time the data are being recorded. If a code is not found in the OAG, contact the Director, Office of Airline Information (address inside front cover).

In the above example, the passenger trip stages or segments are compressed into the maximum of 7 stages so that several intermediate city-pairs (Los Angeles to Seattle to Anchorage, or LAX—SEA—Anc) and the related carriers have not been recorded, as prescribed below in this Section V.D.(3)(e). In addition, after the fourth city-pair (Los Angeles-Salt Lake City), the passenger trip itinerary moves from the initial four-part ticket booklet onto another “conjunction” ticket, and the summary fare code data are not recorded beyond the initial four-part ticket.

\(b\) All entries for operating and ticketed carriers for a coupon stage of an itinerary are to be recorded using two character IATA-assigned or DOT codes, as in the above example. Note that the fare code summary was properly inserted after the ticketed carrier's code, i.e., UA for United Air Lines and Y for unrestricted coach class service. When a two-character carrier code is shown on the ticket, record that code for the ticketed carrier. However, if a code is obviously incorrect, record the correct carrier code. If the reporting carrier does not know the operating carrier on a downline code-share segment, it would use the ticketed carrier's code for both the operating and ticketed carriers. The reporting carrier is not responsible for knowing the operating carrier of a downline code-share where it is not a party to the code-share segment. Except for the infrequent compression of data to fit into the stage-length limitation (7 or 23 stages at the carrier's option), all carrier codes are to be recorded, including data on air taxis, commuters, intra-state, and other carrier portions of itineraries. On tickets involving interchange service or other cooperative carrier arrangements, the juncture point(s) where the passenger moves from one carrier system to another is to be recorded as an intermediate point in the itinerary, even when not shown on the ticket and even though the flight may overfly the juncture point.

\(c\) Entries for fare-basis codes are to be taken from the “fare basis” and “fare description” portions of the ticket and simplified into the appropriate category, as shown below. No attempt shall be made to determine and record fare-basis codes for that portion of a conjunction ticket appearing in the ticket. Fare-basis codes are to be recorded in one-character alphabetic codes. The fare-basis codes are recorded as follows:

C—Unrestricted Business Class

D—Restricted Business Class

F—Unrestricted First Class

G—Restricted First Class

X—Restricted Coach/Economy Class

Y—Unrestricted Coach/Economy Class

U—Unknown (This fare category is used when none is shown on a ticket coupon, or when a fare category is not discernible, or when two or more carrier fare codes are compressed into a single stage of a passenger trip).

\(d\) In recording the number of passengers, each single-passenger ticket is to be recorded as one passenger. Tickets for infants under two years of age not occupying a seat are not to be counted. A revenue passenger is defined in Section X.

For group tickets of 10 or fewer passengers per ticket record the actual number of passengers on each ticket, *i.e.,* either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. For group tickets with 11 or more passengers (those sampled at a 100-percent rate) record the actual number of passengers traveling on each ticket, but keep these entries separate from the group ticket records with 10 or fewer passengers and from the single-passenger ticket records. Group tickets with 11 or more passengers are to be sorted and summarized to combine all passengers for all itineraries which are identical in every respect, *i.e.,* points, carriers, fare basis codes, and average dollar value (as defined in paragraph (e), below). The total number of passengers on each summarized record is to be divided by 10, rounding to the nearest whole passenger. If the quotient ends in 0.5 or more, raise to the next whole passenger. If the quotient ends in less than 0.5, drop the fraction. These large group-ticket records, after division by 10 for compatibility with the other data, are to be merged with the single-passenger records and with the group-ticket entries from tickets of 10 or fewer passengers for the quarterly O&D Survey report.

\(e\) The total dollar value shall be taken from the “Total” box on each ticket and shall be the sum of the fare plus tax for the entire ticket. Record this amount in whole U.S. dollars, with the cents dropped. Do not round cents to nearest whole dollar.

Amounts on tickets stated in foreign currency are to be converted to U.S. dollar equivalents. For *all group tickets,* the dollar value to be recorded shall be the average amount per passenger, determined by dividing the total dollar value for the entire group by the number of passengers on the group ticket, dropping cents in the average amount.

\(3\) The *length of the itineraries to be recorded is limited* to a maximum of seven stages or twenty-three stages, at the carrier's option. This recognizes that the vast majority of tickets sampled have seven stages or fewer and that the rare occurrences of extremely lengthy itineraries do not impact the overall Survey results enough to justify their reporting burden. Therefore, trips longer than these limits are *compressed* to fall within the stated maximums. The ticketed origin and destination are retained, but the *intermediate routing is compressed* by applying the following rules, in sequence:

\(a\) Combine any contiguous open, unknown carrier, or surface stages eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different:

\(b\) Combine any contiguous stages via the same non-U.S. carrier, eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different;

\(c\) Combine any contiguous stages via different non-U.S. carrier, making the carrier “UK”, eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring fare-basis codes, if different:

\(d\) Combine any contiguous stages via the *same U.S. carrier,* eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different, and;

\(e\) If the trip, after applying the four steps above, is still too long, record the compressed routing through to the stage length limitation city (seventh or twenty-third city), enter UK as the final carrier, and then record the ticketed destination as the next (the 8th or 24th) city.

# VI. Summarization of Recorded Data

A. *General.* Prior to the submission of each quarterly report to the Department, each carrier is to summarize the data in accordance with the rules in Section VI.B. In special hardship cases, carriers may submit a waiver request (with justification under Section 1-2 of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0241 Uniform system of accounts and reports for large certificated air carriers\|14 CFR part 241]]) requesting permission to report their flight coupon records exactly as represented on their lifted tickets. Waiver requests must provide the documentation described in Section VI.C. so that the Department can develop the necessary procedures and edit routines to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the overall O&D Survey results. The granting of such waivers will depend upon the availability of resources for the Department to assume this additional burden, which can only be determined on a case by case basis, after evaluating each carrier's need.

B. *Rules for Summarization.* Sort the recorded entries into sequence by the entire record (excluding the passenger field) *i.e.,* by origin, complete routing (including fare-basis codes), tickets destination, and dollar value of ticket. *All identical records are then to be combined into one summary record.* The number of passengers on the summary record is to be the sum of the passenger amounts of all the individual records combined. Passengers are only summarized where records are identical in all respects except in the number of passengers including dollar value of ticket. *Note:* Do not summarize dollars over identical records. This summarization is to include the entries from group tickets, but only after the entries for *group tickets with 11 or more passengers have been summarized and divided by 10,* as stated in Section V.D.(2)(d).

C. *Waiver Requests.* Requests for permission to depart from the required O&D Survey procedures should include a *procedural statement* describing the process the carrier proposed to employ in *examining, selecting and editing* the data from reportable flight coupons for the O&D Survey, as well as a flow chart diagramming the proposed procedures.

D. *Quantity and Quality Controls.* Carriers are expected to establish and maintain *continuous quantity and quality* controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through their system processes to determine the total *number of coupons handled* and the number of reportable *coupons selected.* Such data controls and tests have not been specified by the Department, and necessarily must be developed by each carrier. Each participating carrier shall develop and use on a continuous basis such control tests as are necessary to ensure that all reportable coupons are being selected, recorded and reported as intended by these O&D Survey Instructions. Such controls should extend over all ADP processing, both in-house and that from external service bureaus.

# VII. Editing of Recorded Data

A. *City and Airport Codes.* Prior to submission of O&D Survey reports, each carrier is to edit the recorded data to validate city and airport codes. This edit is to verify that the codes recorded are valid official codes, and it is independent of whether or not the carriers shown actually operated into or out of the airport shown. Any questions about airport codes should be addressed to the Director, Office of Airline Information (see inside of cover).

B. *Edit Responsibility of Carriers.* Each carrier is responsible for developing edit procedures and internal controls over its data entry and processing procedures so that valid and reliable data are captured in the O&D Survey inputs and are properly summarized in the outputs. Since the carriers have many different statistical systems, it is not practicable for the Department of Transportation to prescribe specific controls in this area, and each carrier is responsible for developing the appropriate internal control procedures to edit the O&D Survey data and ensure the integrity of these data. The Department will control the accuracy of its processing of the sampled data upon receipt from the carriers.

C. *System Documentation of Edits.* Carriers are required to maintain written O&D Survey procedural statements and flow charts. As provided in Section VIII, these must be established, or re-certified as of July 1, 1987, and thereafter when significant procedural revisions occur.

# VIII. Control of Sample Selection and Data Recording

A. *Sample Accuracy and Reliability.* In order to maximize the accuracy and reliability of the sample selection and data recording, each carrier is to:

\(1\) Develop a written statement describing the procedures it will employ in examining and selecting reportable flight coupons and in recording, summarizing, editing, and testing the Survey data.

\(2\) Submit any proposed changes in the above procedures to the Department's Office of Airline Information, prior to implementation of such changes.

\(3\) Establish continuous quantity controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through the carrier's accounting processing to determine the total number of coupons handled, and the number of reportable coupons selected. Tests are to be made continuously to assure that all reportable coupons are being selected and the data recorded. Such tests should be completed while the “lifted” flight coupons (representing earned passenger revenues for flight segments operated) remain in the possession of the carrier. Establish such other internal control procedures as are necessary for supervising and monitoring the accuracy of the recording of data from reportable flight coupons.

B. *Staff Review.* The OAI staff will review the carrier procedures and practices and may request modifications or the use of special procedures necessary to improve the sample or to bolster the controls for accuracy and reliability.

### General Reporting Provisions—Large Certificated Air Carriers

### Section 21   Introduction to System of Reports

\(a\) Each large certificated air carrier shall file with the BTS, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually BTS Form 41 Reports of financial and operating statistics as prescribed herein unless waiver has been made by the BTS.

\(b\) The system prescribed provides for the submission by each air carrier of four classes of financial and operating statistics, on individual schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report, grouped as follows:

\(c\) The prescribed system of reports provides that the frequency of reporting shall be monthly for some schedules, quarterly for some, semiannually for some and annually for others. It also provides in some areas for the classification of large certificated air carriers into Group I, Group II, and Group III with the form and content differentiated as between groups.

\(d\) Each schedule of the prescribed BTS Form 41 Report has been assigned a specific code. The prefix alphabetical codes A, B, P and T, respectively, have been employed to denote certification, balance sheet, profit and loss, and traffic and capacity. The digits immediately following the alphabetical prefix designate the particular schedule.

\(e\) \[Reserved\]

\(f\) \[Reserved\]

\(g\) Four separate air carrier entities shall be established for large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled service for the purpose of submitting the prescribed reports. They are as follows: (1) Domestic operations; (2) operations via the Atlantic Ocean; (3) operations via the Pacific Ocean; and (4) operations in Latin American areas. With respect to the first classification, the domestic entity shall embrace all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and shall also include Canadian transborder operations. The reports to be submitted by each entity shall be comparable to those required of a distinct legal entity whether the reporting entity constitutes such an entity, a semiautonomous physically separated operating division of the carrier, or an entity established for reporting purposes only.

\(h\) Two separate entities shall be established for large certificated air carriers predominantly engaged in conducting charter activities for the purpose of submitting the prescribed reports: (1) Domestic operations; and (2) international operations. The domestic entity includes all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All other operations will be in the international entity.

\(i\) The entities for which separate reports shall be made by the different route and charter air carriers will be set semiannually by the Office of Airline Information.

\(j\) As a general rule separate reports shall be filed for the air carrier and for each associated company air carriers as defined in section 03 which is an air carrier. However, transactions of associated companies in which 100 percent equity control resides in the reporting air carrier shall be consolidated with transactions of the reporting air carrier when such associated companies perform services related to the transport operations of the reporting air carrier almost exclusively and are not engaged in air transportation for their own account.

\(k\) Generally, route air carriers' nonscheduled services shall be treated as an integral part of the reporting entity to which most closely related without regard to the geographic area in which such nonscheduled services may actually be performed. However, supplemental reports shall be made of nonscheduled services (including service for the Department of Defense) in areas not encompassed by the prescribed reporting entity in any month in which the available ton-miles of such nonscheduled services exceed 5 percent of the available ton-miles of the reporting entity. Such supplemental reports shall continue until waived by the BTS upon a showing that such nonscheduled operations will not in the subsequent 12-month period exceed the 5-percent limit. The supplemental reports to be filed each month or calendar quarter, as applicable, shall be comprised of report Schedules P-5, T-1, and T-2. Transport and nontransport revenues pertaining to such separately reported nonscheduled services shall be reported on Schedule P-2 each quarter.

\(l\) When and as required in the national interest, any air carrier which performs nonscheduled transport services for the Department of Defense shall, when directed by the Department, make separate reports for such services as if they were conducted by a physically separate transport entity, such reports shall consist of Schedules P-1 through P-7, T-1, and T-2. The letter “D” shall be inserted on such reports, following the schedule number of each P and T schedule. When a carrier has more than one reporting entity, nonscheduled transport and nonscheduled Defense services shall be assigned to the reporting entity to which more closely related.

<sup>1</sup>Due dates falling on a Saturday, Sunday or national holiday will become effective the first following work day.

<sup>2</sup>Reporting due dates on Form 41 Schedules B and P are extended to March 30 if preliminary schedules are filed at the Department by February 10

</div>

</div>

\(b\) Each large certificated air carrier shall file the applicable schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report with the BTS in accordance with the above instructions with the following exceptions:

\(1\) The time for filing B and P report schedules for the final quarter or semiannual period of each calendar year may be extended to the following March 30 if the preliminary Schedules B-1 or B-1.1 and P-1.1 or P-1.2 are submitted, as applicable, and are received on or before their respective due dates.

\(2\) For the third month of any calendar quarter, Schedule P-1(a) need not be filed if Schedule P-1.1 or P-1.2 for the quarter or semiannual period, as applicable, is received on the due date prescribed for Schedule P-1(a).

\(3\) Income and expense data on Schedule P-1(a) for each month will be withheld by the BTS from public disclosure, until such time as (i) the semiannual or quarterly financial reports are due, (ii) the semiannual or quarterly financial reports are filed, or (iii) information covered by monthly reports is publicly released by the carrier concerned, whichever occurs first. Before that time, income and expense data reported on Schedule P-1(a) will be disclosed to parties to any proceeding before the DOT to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the administrative law judge assigned to the case or by the DOT. Any data to which access is granted may be introduced into evidence, subject to the normal rules of admissibility of evidence. The DOT will make other disclosure of these data upon its own motion or upon application of any interested person, when the DOT finds the public interest so requires. The BTS may, from time to time, publish summary information compiled from Schedule P-1(a) in a form which will not identify the individual carrier. At the request of an air carrier, and upon a showing by such air carriers that public disclosure of its preliminary year-end report would adversely affect its interests and would not be in the public interest, the BTS will withhold such preliminary year-end report from public disclosure until such time as (i) the final report is filed, (ii) the final report is due, or (iii) information covered by the preliminary report is publicly released by the carrier concerned, whichever occurs first.

\(c\) If circumstances prevent the filing of a report on or before the prescribed due date, consideration will be given to the granting of an extension upon receipt of a written request therefor. To provide ample time for consideration and communication to the air carrier of the action taken, such a request must be delivered to the BTS in writing at least three (3) days in advance of the due date, setting forth good and sufficient reason to justify the granting of the extension and the date when the report can be filed. Except in cases of emergency, no such request will be entertained which is not in writing and received by the BTS at least three (3) days before the prescribed due date. If a request is denied, the air carrier remains subject to the filing requirements to the same extent as if no request for extension of time had been made.

\(d\) \[Reserved\]

\(e\) All financial data reported on B, P and G schedules shall reflect the status of the air carrier's books of account for the period for which the report is being made and shall conform to the instructions contained in this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports. At the option of the air carrier, Group III air carriers may round reported financial data to the nearest thousands of dollars by typing “(\$000)” at the top of each amount column. All Group I and Group II air carriers may, at their option, round reported financial data to the nearest whole dollars by dropping the cents. All rounded amounts must be balanced within and between schedules. This option applies only to the submission of hardcopy reports. Instructions for the submission of data in ADP format are contained in the Accounting and Reporting Directives, which are available from OAI.

\(f\) Traffic and other operational statistics included in schedules of the BTS Form 41 reports shall reflect data pertaining to the month, quarter or 12-months-to-date period for which the report is being made.

\(g\) Adjustments correcting errors in previously reported traffic and other operational statistics shall not be included in data reported in schedules for the current period but shall be effected by submission of corrected schedules for the period to which applicable or, if only a few items are involved, by written notice and authorization to the BTS to correct previously filed reports except that any correction which amounts to less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the corrected amount for the month to which related may be included in the report for the current month provided the amount of the correction is clearly noted on the Form 41 Report.

\(h\) All letters and statements of correction or revision of reported data shall be a part of the BTS Form 41 reports.

\(i\) All changes in accounting methods having a material impact upon the particular financial elements involved, and all changes in methods of computing and reporting traffic and capacity statistics having a material impact upon the particular statistic involved shall be adequately explained and identified in the report first reflecting such changes. Such explanations related to financial position or financial results shall be made on BTS Form 41 Schedule P-2. Changes in methods for computing or reporting traffic and capacity statistics shall be identified and explained on a separate sheet attached to the first report affected. (See sec. 2-16.) The reporting requirements shall not be construed, in any sense, as relieving the air carrier of the responsibility for conforming its procedures to those otherwise prescribed in this system of accounts and reports.

\(j\) All financial statements released by carriers to the public reflecting a financial position or operating results for dates or reporting periods not covered by reports on file with the BTS shall be filed with the Board simultaneously with their public release.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2138-0013)

\(m\) All substantive matters that may materially influence interpretations or conclusions in regard to the financial condition or the earnings position of the air carrier which are not clearly identified in the body of the schedule or which represent information that cannot be expressed adequately in monetary terms shall be completely and clearly stated in a note attached to this schedule and cross-referenced to the affected account or accounts.

### Schedule B-7 Airframe and Aircraft Engine Acquisitions and Retirements

\(a\) This schedule shall be filed by all Group II and Group III air carriers.

\(b\) Data applicable to acquisitions and data applicable to retirements shall be grouped and reported separately. The data reported within each group (acquisitions; retirements) shall be further subgrouped and reported as follows:

\(1\) Acquisitions: the indicated data shall be reported for each individual airframe, identified by type, model, and design of cabin as to use for passengers exclusively, cargo exclusively, or both passengers and cargo in combination. Data pertaining to aircraft engines shall be reported in aggregate for each type or model; however, leased aircraft engines shall be separately reported under captions entitled: Capital Leases—Aircraft Engines; and Operating Leases—Aircraft Engines. Airframe units leased from others for a period of more than 90 days shall be reported in a separate subsection of this schedule, captioned as follows: Capital Leases—Airframe Units; and Operating Leases—Airframe Units. In addition, a notation shall be made by license number of airframe units of the air carrier returned after lease to others for a period of more than 90 days. Airframe units obtained through interchange lease arrangements shall not be so reported.

\(2\) Retirements: The indicated data shall be reported for the sale or retirement of each airframe, each type of aircraft engine (stating the number of units retired) and, to the extent retired along with airframes and engines, in aggregates by accounts, operating property and equipment included in accounts 1607 and 1608 and nonoperating property and equipment included in accounts 1707 and 1708. Disposition of properties in accounts 1608 and 1708 not related to airframe and aircraft engine retirements shall be reported in a separate group for each account. Airframe units leased from others for a period of more than 90 days shall be reported, upon return to the lessor, in a separate subsection of this schedule and captioned as follows: Capital Leases—Airframe Units; and Operating Leases—Airframe Units. In addition, a notation shall be made by license number and name of lessee of airframe units leased to others for a period of more than 90 days; moreover, airframe units leased to others under sales-type or direct financing leases shall be separately captioned and reported on this schedule. Airframe units leased under interchange arrangements shall not be so reported. Aircraft engines leased from others for a period of more than 90 days shall be reported, upon return to the lessor, in a separate subsection of this schedule and captioned as follows: Capital Leases—Aircraft Engines; and Operating Leases—Aircraft Engines. In addition, a notation shall be made by model number, number of units, and name of lessee of aircraft engines leased to others for a period of more than 90 days; moreover, aircraft engines leased to others under sales-type or direct financing leases shall be separately captioned and reported on this schedule. Aircraft engines leased under interchange arrangements shall not be so reported.

\(c\) All dates shall indicate the day, the month and the year; shall be provided on a unit basis for airframes only, and, shall be reported for each aircraft engine group by date of transaction.

\(d\) Column 1, “Year of First Delivery—Airframe,” shall reflect, for each reported airframe, the year that the airframe was first delivered by its manufacturer.

\(e\) Column 2, “Airframe Manufacturer's Serial Number,” shall reflect the serial number assigned to each reported airframe by its manufacturer.

\(f\) Column 4, “Acquisitions or Retirements,” shall be used to indicate, for each item entered, whether it represents an acquisition or retirement. This shall be indicated by inserting in Column 4 an “A” for acquisition or an “R” for retirement.

\(g\) Column 8, “Maximum Seating Capacity,” shall reflect the number of passenger seats installed in each airframe acquired. When airframes are designed for multiple adjustable seating configurations, the maximum number of seats for which designed shall be reported. When the seating configuration of airframes is modified subsequent to original acquisition, the revised passenger capacity of each airfame shall be reported in the quarter in which modified and referenced to identify original capacity reported.

\(h\) Column 9, “Cost,” shall reflect the book cost of reported airframe and aircraft engine acquisitions and retirements.

\(i\) Column 10, “Amortization/Depreciated Cost,” shall reflect the book cost, less amortization or depreciation expense, for airframes and aircraft engines that have been retired.

\(j\) Column 11, “Realization,” shall reflect the proceeds from the disposition of airframes and aircraft engines, including any insurance proceeds.

\(k\) Column 12, “Acquired From/Disposition,” shall reflect: (1) for acquisitions: the name of the person or organization from which airframes and aircraft engines are acquired and (2) for dispositions (retirements): the name of the person or organization to which airframes and aircraft engines are sold or a notation as to the nature of the retirement and the account to which any depreciated cost has been charged, if not sold. Items included in accounts 1607, 1608, 1707, and 1708, sold as a part of an airframe or aircraft sales transaction, shall also be identified by the name of the buyer. Other sales of items included in these accounts shall be reported in a separate group in aggregate for each property account affected.

### Schedule B-12—Statement of Cash Flows

\(a\) This Schedule shall be filed quarterly by all Group II and Group III air carriers and Group I air carriers that have annual operating revenues of \$20 million or more.

\(b\) This schedule shall be filed for the overall or system operations of the air carrier.

\(c\) The statement of cash flows shall separately disclose the amount of net cash provided or used during the reporting period from the carrier's operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The effect on cash and cash equivalents of the total amount of net cash provided or used during the quarter from each of the above activities shall be clearly disclosed so as to reconcile beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents.

\(d\) Carriers may use either the direct or indirect method of reporting cash flows. Under either method, the reporting of cash flows from investing and financing activities will remain the same. However, the reporting of cash flows from operating activities does differ between the two methods.

\(e\) For carriers electing to use the direct method, cash flows from operating activities are reported as gross amounts of the principal components of cash receipts and cash payments from operating activities, such as cash received from passengers and shippers, cash paid to suppliers, and cash paid to employees. Each carrier using the direct method shall provide as part of its statement of cash flows, a separate schedule that reconciles net income (as reported on Schedule P-1.2 in Account 9899) to cash flow from operating activities.

\(f\) For carriers electing to use the indirect method, cash flows from operating activities shall reflect net income (as reported on Schedule P-1.2 in Account 9899) along with the adjustments necessary to reconcile net income (Account 9899) to net cash for the period (Net Cash Provided or Used By Operating Activities).

\(g\) Regardless of the method used, the statement of cash flows shall reflect the amount of net cash flow provided or used by operating activities during the reporting period.

\(h\) The balance of “Cash and Cash Equivalents,” at the beginning and ending of the quarterly period covered by the report, should equal the sum of Accounts 1010, “Cash,” and 1100, “Short-term Investments,” as reported on the immediately preceding and current quarterly Schedule B-1, “Balance Sheet.” If the sum of these two accounts does not equal the total “Cash and Cash Equivalents” reported on the statement of cash flows, then a footnote explaining the difference shall be provided as part of the statement of cash flows.

\(i\) Carriers shall submit Schedule B-12 in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.

### Schedule B-43—Inventory of Airframes and Aircraft Engines

\(a\) This schedule shall be filed by all Group I, Group II and Group III air carriers.

\(b\) The indicated data shall be reported for each individual airframe, identified by type, model and design of cabin (main deck) as to use for passengers exclusively, cargo exclusively, or both passengers and cargo in combination. Type and model refers to aircraft models such as B-707-100, B-707-200, DC-10-40, Beech-18, Piper PA-32, etc. Aircraft type designations are prescribed in Accounting and Reporting Directive No. 178, “List of Aircraft Type Numeric Codes.” Copies of this directive and subsequent updates to the list of aircraft type codes are available from the Department's Office of Airline Information. Airframes that are authorized for operation over water under FAA regulation FAR 121 shall be so indicated by asterisk.

\(c\) Data pertaining to aircraft engines shall be reported on a group basis by type of engine and by type of aircraft to which related.

\(d\) Data in this schedule shall be grouped and subtotaled as data pertaining to airframes and data pertaining to aircraft engines. Data pertaining to nonoperating airframes and aircraft engines shall be reported in a group below the data for operating equipment. Data pertaining to airframes and aircraft engines obtained under operating and capital leases shall be reported, by type of lease, in a separately captioned grouping below nonoperating airframes and aircraft engines and subgrouped within those groups according to operating and nonoperating equipment.

\(e\) Column 1, “Year of First Delivery—Airframe,” shall reflect, for each reported airframe, the year that the airframe was first delivered by its manufacturer.

\(f\) Column 2, “Airframe Manufacturer's Serial Number,” shall reflect the serial number assigned to each reported airframe by its manufacturer.

\(g\) Data pertaining to airframes and aircraft engines obtained under operating leases shall be listed in Columns 1 through 9; the cost of improvements to equipment under operating leases shall be reported in Columns 10 through 12.

\(h\) Column 9, “Available Capacity (Weight),” shall reflect, for each reported aircraft type, the available capacity (stated in pounds) that is used in computing the available ton-miles reported on Schedules T-100, T-1, and T-2.

\(i\) Column 10, “Acquired Cost or Capitalized Value,” shall include (1) the acquisition cost of owned airframes and aircraft engines; (2) the total capitalized cost of obtaining airframes and engines under capital leases; and (3) the cost of improvements to airframes and engines obtained under operating leases.

\(j\) Column 11, “Allowance for Depreciation or Amortization,” shall include (1) the accumulations of all provisions for losses due to use and obsolescence that are applicable to owned airframes and aircraft engines, (2) the amount of amortization recorded for amortizing the value of airframes and engines obtained under capital leases, and (3) the amount of amortization recorded for amortizing the value of improvements to airframes and aircraft engines obtained under operating leases.

\(k\) Column 12, “Depreciated Cost or Amortized Value,” shall be calculated as either (1) Acquired Cost (Column 10) less the Allowance for Depreciation (Column 11) or (2) Capitalized Value (Column 10) less Amortization (Column 11).

\(l\) Column 13, “Estimated Residual Value,” shall state, in dollars, the residual value assigned to owned and capital-leased airframes and aircraft engines, including any overhaul value not subject to depreciation.

\(m\) Column 14, “Estimated Depreciable or Amortizable Life (Months),” shall state the estimated depreciable or amortizable life from the date of acquisition of each airframe and each group of aircraft engines.

\(i\) *Public Service Revenue.* This category shall include amounts of compensation paid to the carrier under 49 U.S.C 41733.

\(ii\) *Other.* This category shall include other transport-related revenue such as in-flight sales, restaurant and food service (ground), rental of property or equipment, limousine service, interchange sales, and cargo pick-up and delivery charges.

\(e\) “Operating Expense” shall be segregated as follows:

\(1\) “Flying Operations” shall include expenses incurred directly in the in-flight operation of aircraft and expenses incurred in the holding of aircraft and aircraft operation personnel in readiness for assignment to an in-flight status.

\(2\) “Maintenance” shall include all expenses which are specifically identifiable with the repair and upkeep of property and equipment used in the performance of air transportation.

\(3\) “General and Administrative” shall include that portion of all expenses of a general corporate nature and all other expenses not provided for elsewhere which are related to air transport operations either directly or indirectly.

\(f\) “Operating Profit (Loss)” shall be computed by subtracting the total operating expenses from the total operating revenues.

\(g\) “Nonoperating Income and Expense” shall include all revenues and expenses resulting from commercial ventures which are not inherently related to the performance of air transport services. For example, the revenues and expenses related to operating a hotel or motel would be reported under this category. This category shall also include the total interest expense incurred from all sources and shall be subdivided as follows:

\(1\) Interest Expense.

\(2\) Other Nonoperating (Net).

\(h\) “Income Tax” shall reflect the provisions for accruals of Federal, State, local, and foreign taxes based upon taxable income, and computed at the normal and surtax rates in effect during the current accounting year.

\(i\) “Discontinued Operations, Extraordinary Items or Accounting Changes” shall reflect any earnings or losses from discontinued operations, the net of the tax amount of extraordinary items, and the cumulative effect of any changes in accounting principles.

\(j\) Any air carrier that does not file Schedule P-1(a) in accordance with the filing option described in section 22—General Reporting Instructions shall, for the sixth month of any semi-annual period during which the option is exercised, type in the bottom margin of this statement of operations the total number of full-time and part-time employees to be labeled as such and calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of the reporting instructions for Schedule P-1(a).

### Schedule P-1.2—Statement of Operations

\(a\) This schedule shall be filed quarterly by all Group II and Group III air carriers and Group I air carriers that have annual operating revenues of \$20 million or more.

First class and coach passenger revenues associated with transport operations reported in the domestic entity shall be reported as a combined total in Account 3901 Transport Revenues-Passenger.

\(f\) All Group I and Group II air carriers shall report first class and coach passenger revenues as a combined total in Account 3901 Transport Revenues-Passenger, for both domestic and international entity operations. However, U.S. air carriers in any carrier group that elect to do so may continue to report first class and coach revenue data, if they consider such voluntary reporting to be less burdensome than changing their existing financial reporting system.

\(g\) Any air carrier that does not file Schedule P-1(a) in accordance with the filing option described in section 22—General Reporting Instructions shall, for the third month of any calendar quarter during which the option is exercised, type in the bottom margin of the system statement of operations the total number of full-time and part-time employees to be labeled as such and calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of the reporting instructions for Schedule P-1(a).

\(g\) The cost of fuel shall include shrinkage but exclude (1) “through-put” and “in to plane” fees, *i.e.,* service charges or gallonage levies assessed by or against the fuel vendor or concessionaire and passed on to the carrier in a separately identifiable form and (2) nonrefundable Federal and State excise taxes. However, “through-put” and “in to plane” charges that cannot be identified or segregated from the cost of fuel shall remain a part of the cost of fuel as reported on this schedule.

\(h\) Each air carrier shall maintain records for each station showing the computation of fuel inventories and consumption for each fuel type. The periodic average cost method shall be used in computing fuel inventories and consumption. Under this method, an average unit cost for each fuel type shall be computed by dividing the total cost of fuel available (Beginning Inventory plus Purchases) by the total gallons available. The resulting unit cost shall then be used to determine the ending inventory and the total consumption costs to be reported on this schedule.

\(i\) Where amounts reported for a specific entity include other than Jet A fuel, a footnote shall be added indicating the number of gallons and applicable costs of such other fuel included in amounts reported for that entity.

\(j\) Where any adjustment(s) recorded on the books of the carrier results in a material distortion of the current month's schedule, carriers shall file a revised schedule P-12(a) for the month(s) affected.

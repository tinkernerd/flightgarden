## Subpart A—General

### §294.1   Applicability and purpose.

This part establishes a classification of foreign air carriers known as “Canadian charter air taxi operators,” and establishes registration procedures for these carriers operating or seeking to operate transborder services between Canada and the United States. This part also exempts Canadian charter air taxi operators from certain provisions of the Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), and establishes rules applicable to their operations in the United States. This part does not provide exemption from the safety regulatory provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII that are administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Canadian charter air taxi operators in the conduct of their operations must observe all applicable safety standards and requirements.

\[ER-1257, 46 FR 52591, Oct. 27, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 43526, Aug. 22, 1995\]

### §294.2   Definitions.

As used in this part:

\(a\) *Agreement* means the *Air Transport Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada*, signed at Ottawa, February 24, 1995, with Annexes and any amendments, supplements, reservations, or supersessions to it.

\(b\) *Canadian charter air taxi operator* means a foreign air carrier that is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Canadian citizens, the Government of Canada, or both, whose foreign air transportation operations are limited to charter air service between points in Canada and points in the United States, and that does not use large aircraft in those operations.

\(c\) *Charter air service* means nonscheduled commercial air transportation of persons and their accompanied baggage, and of property, on a time, mileage, or trip basis where the entire planeload capacity of one or more aircraft has been engaged, or the transportation of mail by aircraft.

\(d\) *Large aircraft* means any aircraft that are not *small aircraft* as defined in this section.

\(e\) *Maximum authorized takeoff weight* has the meaning assigned to it in regulations of the Canadian Transport Commission.

\(f\) *Maximum certificated takeoff weight* means the maximum takeoff weight authorized by the terms of the aircraft airworthiness certificate. This weight may be found in the airplane operating record or in the airplane flight manual that is incorporated by regulation into the airworthiness certificate.

\(g\) *Maximum passenger capacity* means the maximum number of passenger seats for which an aircraft is configured.

\(h\) *Maximum payload capacity* means the maximum certificated takeoff weight of an aircraft less the empty weight as defined in section 03 of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0241 Uniform system of accounts and reports for large certificated air carriers\|part 241 of this chapter]], less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum fuel load, oil, flight crew, steward's supplies, etc.). For purposes of this part, the allowance for weight of the crew, oil and fuel is as follows:

\(1\) Crew—200 pounds per crew member required under FAA regulations in 14 CFR chapter I, (2) oil—350 pounds, (3) fuel—the minimum weight of fuel required under FAA regulations in 14 CFR chapter I for a flight between domestic points 200 miles apart, assuming VFR weather conditions and flights not involving extended overwater operations. However, in the case of aircraft for which a maximum zero fuel weight is prescribed by the FAA, maximum payload capacity means the maximum zero fuel weight less the empty weight, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum flight crew, steward's supplies, etc., but not including disposable fuel or oil).

\(2\) \[Reserved\]

\(i\) *Small aircraft* means any aircraft designed to have:

\(1\) A maximum passenger capacity of not more than 30 seats and a maximum payload capacity of not more than 7,500 pounds, and/or

\(2\) maximum authorized takeoff weight on wheels not greater than 35,000 pounds.

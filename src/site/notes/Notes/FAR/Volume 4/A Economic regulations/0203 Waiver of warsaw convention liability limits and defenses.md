This part requires that certain U.S. and foreign direct air carriers waive the passenger liability limits and certain carrier defenses in the Warsaw Convention in accordance with the provisions of Agreement 18900, dated May 13, 1966, and provides that acceptance of authority for, or operations by the carrier in, air transportation shall be considered to act as such a waiver by that carrier.

### §203.4   Montreal Agreement as part of airline-passenger contract and conditions of carriage.

\(a\) As required by the Montreal Agreement, carriers that are otherwise generally required to file tariffs shall file with the Department's Pricing and Multilateral Affairs Division a tariff that includes the provisions of the counterpart to Agreement 18900.

\(b\) As further required by that Agreement, each participating carrier shall include the Agreement's terms as part of its conditions of carriage. The participating carrier shall give each of its passengers the notice required by the Montreal Agreement as provided in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs#§221.105   Special notice of limited liability under international treaty.\|§221.105]] of this chapter.

Such participation also constitutes a waiver of the defense under Article 20(1) of the Convention that the carrier was not negligent.

Notwithstanding any failure to file that counterpart and such tariff, any such air carrier or foreign air carrier issued license authority (including exemptions) by the Department or operating in air transportation shall be deemed to have agreed to the provisions of Agreement 18900 as fully as if that air carrier or foreign air carrier had in fact filed a properly executed counterpart to that Agreement and tariff.

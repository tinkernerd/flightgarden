### §1310.1   Purpose and scope.

This part is issued by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board pursuant to Section 102(c)(2)(B) of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, Public Law 107-42, 115 Stat. 230 (Act). This part describes the Board's authorities, organizational structure, the rules by which the Board takes actions, and procedures for public access to Board records.

### §1310.2   Composition of the Board.

The Board consists of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the designee of the Chairman, who acts as Chairman of the Board, the Secretary of the Treasury or the designee of the Secretary, the Secretary of Transportation or the designee of the Secretary, and the Comptroller General of the United States or the designee of the Comptroller General, who serves as a nonvoting member. The Comptroller General of the United States or the designee of the Comptroller General, who serves as a nonvoting member, shall not be involved in any of the Board's discussions or deliberations in connection with individual loan guarantee applications.

### §1310.3   Authority of the Board.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Board is authorized to guarantee loans provided to airlines by eligible lenders in accordance with the procedures, rules, and regulations established by the Board, to make the determinations authorized by the Act, and to take such other actions as necessary to carry out its functions specified in the Act.

### §1310.4   Offices.

The principal offices of the Board are at 1120 Vermont Avenue, NW., Suite 970, Washington, DC 20005.

### §1310.5   Meetings and actions of the Board.

\(a\) *Place and frequency.* The Board meets, on the call of the Chairman, in order to consider matters requiring action by the Board. The time and place for any such meeting shall be determined by the members of the Board.

\(b\) *Quorum and voting.* Two voting members of the Board constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. All decisions and determinations of the Board shall be made by a majority vote of the voting members. All votes on determinations of the Board required by the Act shall be recorded in the minutes. A Board member may request that any vote be recorded according to individual Board members.

\(c\) *Agenda of meetings.* As a general rule, an agenda for each meeting shall be distributed to members of the Board at least 48 hours in advance of the date of the meeting, together with copies of materials relevant to the agenda items.

\(d\) *Minutes.* The Chief Administrative Officer shall keep minutes of each Board meeting and of action taken without a meeting, a draft of which is to be distributed to each member of the Board as soon as practicable after each meeting or action. To the extent practicable, the minutes of a Board meeting shall be corrected and approved at the next meeting of the Board.

\(e\) *Use of conference call communications equipment.* Any member may participate in a meeting of the Board through the use of conference call, telephone or similar communications equipment, by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can simultaneously speak to and hear each other. Any member so participating in a meeting shall be deemed present for all purposes, except that the Comptroller General of the United States or the designee of the Comptroller General, who serves as a nonvoting member, shall not participate in any of the Board's discussions or deliberations in connection with individual loan guarantee applications. Actions taken by the Board at meetings conducted through the use of such equipment, including the votes of each member, shall be recorded in the usual manner in the minutes of the meetings of the Board.

\(f\) *Actions between meetings.* When, in the judgment of the Chairman, it is desirable for the Board to consider action without holding a meeting, the relevant information and recommendations for action may be transmitted to the members by the Chief Administrative Officer and the voting members may communicate their votes to the Chairman in writing (including an action signed in counterpart by each Board member), electronically, or orally (including telephone communication). Any action taken under this paragraph has the same effect as an action taken at a meeting. Any such action shall be recorded in the minutes. If a voting member believes the matter should be considered at a meeting, the member may so notify the Chief Administrative Officer and the matter will be scheduled for consideration at a meeting.

\(g\) *Delegations of authority.* The Board may delegate authority, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate, to the Executive Director, the Legal Counsel, or the Chief Administrative Officer, to take certain actions not required by the Act to be taken by the Board.

Any action taken pursuant to delegated authority has the effect of an action taken by the Board.

### §33.15   Materials.

The suitability and durability of materials used in the engine must—

\(a\) Be established on the basis of experience or tests; and

\(b\) Conform to approved specifications (such as industry or military specifications) that ensure their having the strength and other properties assumed in the design data.

(Secs. 313(a), 601, and 603, 72 Stat. 759, 775, 49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421, and 1423; sec. 6(c), 49 U.S.C. 1655(c))

\[Amdt. 33-8, 42 FR 15047, Mar. 17, 1977, as amended by Amdt. 33-10, 49 FR 6850, Feb. 23, 1984\]

### §33.17   Fire protection.

\(a\) The design and construction of the engine and the materials used must minimize the probability of the occurrence and spread of fire during normal operation and failure conditions, and must minimize the effect of such a fire. In addition, the design and construction of turbine engines must minimize the probability of the occurrence of an internal fire that could result in structural failure or other hazardous effects.

\(b\) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each external line, fitting, and other component, which contains or conveys flammable fluid during normal engine operation, must be fire resistant or fireproof, as determined by the Administrator. Components must be shielded or located to safeguard against the ignition of leaking flammable fluid.

\(c\) A tank, which contains flammable fluids and any associated shut-off means and supports, which are part of and attached to the engine, must be fireproof either by construction or by protection unless damage by fire will not cause leakage or spillage of a hazardous quantity of flammable fluid. For a reciprocating engine having an integral oil sump of less than 23.7 liters capacity, the oil sump need not be fireproof or enclosed by a fireproof shield.

\(d\) An engine component designed, constructed, and installed to act as a firewall must be:

\(1\) Fireproof;

\(2\) Constructed so that no hazardous quantity of air, fluid or flame can pass around or through the firewall; and,

\(f\) Unintentional accumulation of hazardous quantities of flammable fluid within the engine must be prevented by draining and venting.

\(g\) Any components, modules, or equipment, which are susceptible to or are potential sources of static discharges or electrical fault currents must be designed and constructed to be properly grounded to the engine reference, to minimize the risk of ignition in external areas where flammable fluids or vapors could be present.

\[Doc. No. FAA-2007-28503, 74 FR 37930, July 30, 2009\]

### §33.19   Durability.

\(a\) Engine design and construction must minimize the development of an unsafe condition of the engine between overhaul periods. The design of the compressor and turbine rotor cases must provide for the containment of damage from rotor blade failure. Energy levels and trajectories of fragments resulting from rotor blade failure that lie outside the compressor and turbine rotor cases must be defined.

\(b\) Each component of the propeller blade pitch control system which is a part of the engine type design must meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0035 Airworthiness standards  propellers#§35.21   Variable and reversible pitch propellers.\|§§35.21]], 35.23, 35.42 and 35.43 of this chapter.

\[Doc. No. 3025, 29 FR 7453, June 10, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 33-9, 45 FR 60181, Sept. 11, 1980; Amdt. 33-10, 49 FR 6851, Feb. 23, 1984; Amdt. 33-28, 73 FR 63346, Oct. 24, 2008\]

\[Amdt. 33-10, 49 FR 6851, Feb. 23, 1984\]

### §33.25   Accessory attachments.

The engine must operate properly with the accessory drive and mounting attachments loaded. Each engine accessory drive and mounting attachment must include provisions for sealing to prevent contamination of, or unacceptable leakage from, the engine interior. A drive and mounting attachment requiring lubrication for external drive splines, or coupling by engine oil, must include provisions for sealing to prevent unacceptable loss of oil and to prevent contamination from sources outside the chamber enclosing the drive connection. The design of the engine must allow for the examination, adjustment, or removal of each accessory required for engine operation.

\[Amdt. 33-10, 49 FR 6851, Feb. 23, 1984\]

### §33.27   Turbine, compressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotor overspeed.

\(a\) For each fan, compressor, turbine, and turbosupercharger rotor, the applicant must establish by test, analysis, or a combination of both, that each rotor will not burst when operated in the engine for 5 minutes at whichever of the conditions defined in paragraph (b) of this section is the most critical with respect to the integrity of such a rotor.

\(1\) Test rotors used to demonstrate compliance with this section that do not have the most adverse combination of material properties and dimensional tolerances must be tested at conditions which have been adjusted to ensure the minimum specification rotor possesses the required overspeed capability. This can be accomplished by increasing test speed, temperature, and/or loads.

\(2\) When an engine test is being used to demonstrate compliance with the overspeed conditions listed in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section and the failure of a component or system is sudden and transient, it may not be possible to operate the engine for 5 minutes after the failure. Under these circumstances, the actual overspeed duration is acceptable if the required maximum overspeed is achieved.

\(b\) When determining the maximum overspeed condition applicable to each rotor in order to comply with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, the applicant must evaluate the following rotor speeds taking into consideration the part's operating temperatures and temperature gradients throughout the engine's operating envelope:

\(1\) 120 percent of the maximum permissible rotor speed associated with any of the engine ratings except one-engine-inoperative (OEI) ratings of less than 21⁄2 minutes.

\(2\) 115 percent of the maximum permissible rotor speed associated with any OEI ratings of less than 21⁄2 minutes.

\(3\) 105 percent of the highest rotor speed that would result from either:

\(i\) The failure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any rating condition except OEI ratings of less than 21⁄2 minutes, or

\(ii\) The failure of any component or system in a representative installation of the engine, in combination with any other failure of a component or system that would not normally be detected during a routine pre-flight check or during normal flight operation, that is the most critical with respect to overspeed, except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, when operating at any rating condition except OEI ratings of less than 21⁄2 minutes.

\(4\) 100 percent of the highest rotor speed that would result from the failure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any OEI rating of less than 21⁄2 minutes.

\(c\) The highest overspeed that results from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor, except as provided by paragraph (f) of this section, must be included in the overspeed conditions considered by paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), and (b)(4) of this section, regardless of whether that overspeed results from a failure within the engine or external to the engine. The overspeed resulting from any other single failure must be considered when selecting the most limiting overspeed conditions applicable to each rotor. Overspeeds resulting from combinations of failures must also be considered unless the applicant can show that the probability of occurrence is not greater than extremely remote (probability range of 10−7 to 10−9 per engine flight hour).

\(d\) In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that each fan, compressor, turbine, and turbosupercharger rotor complies with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section for the maximum overspeed achieved when subjected to the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. The applicant must use the approach in paragraph (a) of this section which specifies the required test conditions.

\(1\) Rotor Growth must not cause the engine to:

\(i\) Catch fire,

\(ii\) Release high-energy debris through the engine casing or result in a hazardous failure of the engine casing,

\(iii\) Generate loads greater than those ultimate loads specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.23   Engine mounting attachments and structure.\|§33.23]](a), or

\(iv\) Lose the capability of being shut down.

\(2\) Following an overspeed event and after continued operation, the rotor may not exhibit conditions such as cracking or distortion which preclude continued safe operation.

\(e\) The design and functioning of engine control systems, instruments, and other methods not covered under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.28   Engine control systems.\|§33.28]] must ensure that the engine operating limitations that affect turbine, compressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotor structural integrity will not be exceeded in service.

\(f\) Failure of a shaft section may be excluded from consideration in determining the highest overspeed that would result from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor if the applicant:

\(1\) Identifies the shaft as an engine life-limited-part and complies with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.70   Engine life-limited parts.\|§33.70]].

\(2\) Uses material and design features that are well understood and that can be analyzed by well-established and validated stress analysis techniques.

\(3\) Determines, based on an assessment of the environment surrounding the shaft section, that environmental influences are unlikely to cause a shaft failure. This assessment must include complexity of design, corrosion, wear, vibration, fire, contact with adjacent components or structure, overheating, and secondary effects from other failures or combination of failures.

\(4\) Identifies and declares, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.5   Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine.\|§33.5]], any assumptions regarding the engine installation in making the assessment described above in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

\(5\) Assesses, and considers as appropriate, experience with shaft sections of similar design.

\(6\) Does not exclude the entire shaft.

\(g\) If analysis is used to meet the overspeed requirements, then the analytical tool must be validated to prior overspeed test results of a similar rotor. The tool must be validated for each material. The rotor being certified must not exceed the boundaries of the rotors being used to validate the analytical tool in terms of geometric shape, operating stress, and temperature. Validation includes the ability to accurately predict rotor dimensional growth and the burst speed. The predictions must also show that the rotor being certified does not have lower burst and growth margins than rotors used to validate the tool.

The means must be such that a complete test of the system can be achieved in the minimum number of cycles. If the test is not fully automatic, the requirement for a manual test must be contained in the engine instructions for operation.

\(3\) When overspeed protection is provided through hydromechanical or mechanical means, the applicant must demonstrate by test or other acceptable means that the overspeed function remains available between inspection and maintenance periods.

\(2\) Be detected and accommodated. The accommodation strategy must not result in an unacceptable change in thrust or power or an unacceptable change in engine operating and starting characteristics. The applicant must evaluate and document in the engine installation instructions the effects of these failures on engine power or thrust, engine operability, and starting characteristics throughout the flight envelope.

\(i\) *Aircraft-supplied electrical power.* (1) The applicant must design the engine control system so that the loss, malfunction, or interruption of electrical power supplied from the aircraft to the engine control system will not result in any of the following:

\[Amdt. 33-6, 39 FR 35465, Oct. 1, 1974\]

### §33.43   Vibration test.

\(a\) Each engine must undergo a vibration survey to establish the torsional and bending vibration characteristics of the crankshaft and the propeller shaft or other output shaft, over the range of crankshaft speed and engine power, under steady state and transient conditions, from idling speed to either 110 percent of the desired maximum continuous speed rating or 103 percent of the maximum desired takeoff speed rating, whichever is higher. The survey must be conducted using, for airplane engines, the same configuration of the propeller type which is used for the endurance test, and using, for other engines, the same configuration of the loading device type which is used for the endurance test.

\(b\) The torsional and bending vibration stresses of the crankshaft and the propeller shaft or other output shaft may not exceed the endurance limit stress of the material from which the shaft is made. If the maximum stress in the shaft cannot be shown to be below the endurance limit by measurement, the vibration frequency and amplitude must be measured. The peak amplitude must be shown to produce a stress below the endurance limit; if not, the engine must be run at the condition producing the peak amplitude until, for steel shafts, 10 million stress reversals have been sustained without fatigue failure and, for other shafts, until it is shown that fatigue will not occur within the endurance limit stress of the material.

\(c\) Each accessory drive and mounting attachment must be loaded, with the loads imposed by each accessory used only for an aircraft service being the limit load specified by the applicant for the drive or attachment point.

\(d\) The vibration survey described in paragraph (a) of this section must be repeated with that cylinder not firing which has the most adverse vibration effect, in order to establish the conditions under which the engine can be operated safely in that abnormal state. However, for this vibration survey, the engine speed range need only extend from idle to the maximum desired takeoff speed, and compliance with paragraph (b) of this section need not be shown.

The results of the power characteristics calibration tests form the basis for establishing the characteristics of the engine over its entire operating range of crankshaft rotational speeds, manifold pressures, fuel/air mixture settings, and altitudes. Power ratings are based upon standard atmospheric conditions with only those accessories installed which are essential for engine functioning.

\(b\) A power check at sea level conditions must be accomplished on the endurance test engine after the endurance test. Any change in power characteristics which occurs during the endurance test must be determined. Measurements taken during the final portion of the endurance test may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.

\(e\) Demonstrate by test, analysis, or combination of the two, acceptable operation for turbojet, turbofan, and turboprop engines in mixed phase and ice crystal icing conditions throughout Appendix D of this part, icing envelope throughout its flight power range, including minimum descent idling speeds.

\[Amdt. 33-34, 79 FR 66536, Nov. 4, 2014\]

### §33.69   Ignitions system.

Each engine must be equipped with an ignition system for starting the engine on the ground and in flight. An electric ignition system must have at least two igniters and two separate secondary electric circuits, except that only one igniter is required for fuel burning augmentation systems.

\[Amdt. 33-6, 39 FR 35466, Oct. 1, 1974\]

### §33.70   Engine life-limited parts.

By a procedure approved by the FAA, operating limitations must be established which specify the maximum allowable number of flight cycles for each engine life-limited part. Engine life-limited parts are rotor and major static structural parts whose primary failure is likely to result in a hazardous engine effect. Typically, engine life-limited parts include, but are not limited to disks, spacers, hubs, shafts, high-pressure casings, and non-redundant mount components. For the purposes of this section, a hazardous engine effect is any of the conditions listed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.75   Safety analysis.\|§33.75]] of this part. The applicant will establish the integrity of each engine life-limited part by:

\(a\) An engineering plan that contains the steps required to ensure each engine life-limited part is withdrawn from service at an approved life before hazardous engine effects can occur. These steps include validated analysis, test, or service experience which ensures that the combination of loads, material properties, environmental influences and operating conditions, including the effects of other engine parts influencing these parameters, are sufficiently well known and predictable so that the operating limitations can be established and maintained for each engine life-limited part. Applicants must perform appropriate damage tolerance assessments to address the potential for failure from material, manufacturing, and service induced anomalies within the approved life of the part. Applicants must publish a list of the life-limited engine parts and the approved life for each part in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness as required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.4   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§33.4]] of this part.

\(b\) A manufacturing plan that identifies the specific manufacturing constraints necessary to consistently produce each engine life-limited part with the attributes required by the engineering plan.

\(c\) A service management plan that defines in-service processes for maintenance and the limitations to repair for each engine life-limited part that will maintain attributes consistent with those required by the engineering plan. These processes and limitations will become part of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.

\[Amdt. 33-22, 72 FR 50860, Sept. 4, 2007\]

### §33.71   Lubrication system.

\(a\) *General.* Each lubrication system must function properly in the flight attitudes and atmospheric conditions in which an aircraft is expected to operate.

\(b\) *Oil strainer or filter.* There must be an oil strainer or filter through which all of the engine oil flows. In addition:

\(1\) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph that has a bypass must be constructed and installed so that oil will flow at the normal rate through the rest of the system with the strainer or filter element completely blocked.

\(2\) The type and degree of filtering necessary for protection of the engine oil system against foreign particles in the oil must be specified. The applicant must demonstrate that foreign particles passing through the specified filtering means do not impair engine oil system functioning.

\(3\) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph must have the capacity (with respect to operating limitations established for the engine) to ensure that engine oil system functioning is not impaired with the oil contaminated to a degree (with respect to particle size and density) that is greater than that established for the engine in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

\(4\) For each strainer or filter required by this paragraph, except the strainer or filter at the oil tank outlet, there must be means to indicate contamination before it reaches the capacity established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

\(5\) Any filter bypass must be designed and constructed so that the release of collected contaminants is minimized by appropriate location of the bypass to ensure that the collected contaminants are not in the bypass flow path.

\(6\) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph that has no bypass, except the strainer or filter at an oil tank outlet or for a scavenge pump, must have provisions for connection with a warning means to warn the pilot of the occurance of contamination of the screen before it reaches the capacity established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

\(7\) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph must be accessible for draining and cleaning.

\(c\) *Oil tanks.* (1) Each oil tank must have an expansion space of not less than 10 percent of the tank capacity.

\(2\) It must be impossible to inadvertently fill the oil tank expansion space.

\(3\) Each recessed oil tank filler connection that can retain any appreciable quantity of oil must have provision for fitting a drain.

\(4\) Each oil tank cap must provide an oil-tight seal. For an applicant seeking eligibility for an engine to be installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS, the oil tank must be designed to prevent a hazardous loss of oil due to an incorrectly installed oil tank cap.

\(5\) Each oil tank filler must be marked with the word “oil.”

\(6\) Each oil tank must be vented from the top part of the expansion space, with the vent so arranged that condensed water vapor that might freeze and obstruct the line cannot accumulate at any point.

\(7\) There must be means to prevent entrance into the oil tank or into any oil tank outlet, of any object that might obstruct the flow of oil through the system.

\(8\) There must be a shutoff valve at the outlet of each oil tank, unless the external portion of the oil system (including oil tank supports) is fireproof.

\(9\) Each unpressurized oil tank may not leak when subjected to a maximum operating temperature and an internal pressure of 5 p.s.i., and each pressurized oil tank must meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.64   Pressurized engine static parts.\|§33.64]].

\(10\) Leaked or spilled oil may not accumulate between the tank and the remainder of the engine.

\(11\) Each oil tank must have an oil quantity indicator or provisions for one.

\(12\) If the propeller feathering system depends on engine oil—

\(i\) There must be means to trap an amount of oil in the tank if the supply becomes depleted due to failure of any part of the lubricating system other than the tank itself;

\(ii\) The amount of trapped oil must be enough to accomplish the feathering opeation and must be available only to the feathering pump; and

\(iii\) Provision must be made to prevent sludge or other foreign matter from affecting the safe operation of the propeller feathering system.

\(d\) *Oil drains.* A drain (or drains) must be provided to allow safe drainage of the oil system. Each drain must—

\(1\) Be accessible; and

\(2\) Have manual or automatic means for positive locking in the closed position.

\(e\) *Oil radiators.* Each oil radiator must withstand, without failure, any vibration, inertia, and oil pressure load to which it is subjected during the block tests.

### §33.72   Hydraulic actuating systems.

Each hydraulic actuating system must function properly under all conditions in which the engine is expected to operate. Each filter or screen must be accessible for servicing and each tank must meet the design criteria of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.71   Lubrication system.\|§33.71]].

\[Amdt. 33-6, 39 FR 35467, Oct. 1, 1974\]

### §33.73   Power or thrust response.

The design and construction of the engine must enable an increase—

\(a\) From minimum to rated takeoff power or thrust with the maximum bleed air and power extraction to be permitted in an aircraft, without overtemperature, surge, stall, or other detrimental factors occurring to the engine whenever the power control lever is moved from the minimum to the maximum position in not more than 1 second, except that the Administrator may allow additional time increments for different regimes of control operation requiring control scheduling; and

\(b\) From the fixed minimum flight idle power lever position when provided, or if not provided, from not more than 15 percent of the rated takeoff power or thrust available to 95 percent rated takeoff power or thrust in not over 5 seconds. The 5-second power or thrust response must occur from a stabilized static condition using only the bleed air and accessories loads necessary to run the engine. This takeoff rating is specified by the applicant and need not include thrust augmentation.

\[Amdt. 33-1, 36 FR 5493, Mar. 24, 1971\]

### §33.74   Continued rotation.

If any of the engine main rotating systems continue to rotate after the engine is shutdown for any reason while in flight, and if means to prevent that continued rotation are not provided, then any continued rotation during the maximum period of flight, and in the flight conditions expected to occur with that engine inoperative, may not result in any condition described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.75   Safety analysis.\|§33.75]](g)(2)(i) through (vi) of this part.

\[Amdt. 33-24, 72 FR 50867, Sept. 4, 2007\]

### §33.75   Safety analysis.

\(a\) (1) The applicant must analyze the engine, including the control system, to assess the likely consequences of all failures that can reasonably be expected to occur. This analysis will take into account, if applicable:

\(i\) Aircraft-level devices and procedures assumed to be associated with a typical installation. Such assumptions must be stated in the analysis.

\(ii\) Consequential secondary failures and latent failures.

\(iii\) Multiple failures referred to in paragraph (d) of this section or that result in the hazardous engine effects defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

\(2\) The applicant must summarize those failures that could result in major engine effects or hazardous engine effects, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, and estimate the probability of occurrence of those effects. Any engine part the failure of which could reasonably result in a hazardous engine effect must be clearly identified in this summary.

\(3\) The applicant must show that hazardous engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as extremely remote (probability range of 10−7 to 10−9 per engine flight hour). Since the estimated probability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the applicant to assess the total rate for hazardous engine effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous engine effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater than 10−8 per engine flight hour. In dealing with probabilities of this low order of magnitude, absolute proof is not possible, and compliance may be shown by reliance on engineering judgment and previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies.

\(4\) The applicant must show that major engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as remote (probability range of 10−5 to 10−7 per engine flight hour).

\(b\) The FAA may require that any assumption as to the effects of failures and likely combination of failures be verified by test.

\(c\) The primary failure of certain single elements cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms. If the failure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous engine effects, then compliance may be shown by reliance on the prescribed integrity requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.15   Materials.\|§§33.15]], 33.27, and 33.70 as applicable. These instances must be stated in the safety analysis.

\(d\) If reliance is placed on a safety system to prevent a failure from progressing to hazardous engine effects, the possibility of a safety system failure in combination with a basic engine failure must be included in the analysis. Such a safety system may include safety devices, instrumentation, early warning devices, maintenance checks, and other similar equipment or procedures. If items of a safety system are outside the control of the engine manufacturer, the assumptions of the safety analysis with respect to the reliability of these parts must be clearly stated in the analysis and identified in the installation instructions under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.5   Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine.\|§33.5]] of this part.

\(e\) If the safety analysis depends on one or more of the following items, those items must be identified in the analysis and appropriately substantiated.

\(1\) Maintenance actions being carried out at stated intervals. This includes the verification of the serviceability of items that could fail in a latent manner. When necessary to prevent hazardous engine effects, these maintenance actions and intervals must be published in the instructions for continued airworthiness required under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.4   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§33.4]] of this part. Additionally, if errors in maintenance of the engine, including the control system, could lead to hazardous engine effects, the appropriate procedures must be included in the relevant engine manuals.

\(2\) Verification of the satisfactory functioning of safety or other devices at pre-flight or other stated periods. The details of this satisfactory functioning must be published in the appropriate manual.

\(3\) The provisions of specific instrumentation not otherwise required.

\(4\) Flight crew actions to be specified in the operating instructions established under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.5   Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine.\|§33.5]].

\(f\) If applicable, the safety analysis must also include, but not be limited to, investigation of the following:

\(1\) Indicating equipment;

\(2\) Manual and automatic controls;

\(3\) Compressor bleed systems;

\(4\) Refrigerant injection systems;

\(5\) Gas temperature control systems;

\(6\) Engine speed, power, or thrust governors and fuel control systems;

\(7\) Engine overspeed, overtemperature, or topping limiters;

\(8\) Propeller control systems; and

\(9\) Engine or propeller thrust reversal systems.

\(g\) Unless otherwise approved by the FAA and stated in the safety analysis, for compliance with part 33, the following failure definitions apply to the engine:

\(1\) An engine failure in which the only consequence is partial or complete loss of thrust or power (and associated engine services) from the engine will be regarded as a minor engine effect.

\(2\) The following effects will be regarded as hazardous engine effects:

\(i\) Non-containment of high-energy debris;

\(ii\) Concentration of toxic products in the engine bleed air intended for the cabin sufficient to incapacitate crew or passengers;

\(iii\) Significant thrust in the opposite direction to that commanded by the pilot;

\(iv\) Uncontrolled fire;

\(v\) Failure of the engine mount system leading to inadvertent engine separation;

\(vi\) Release of the propeller by the engine, if applicable; and

\(vii\) Complete inability to shut the engine down.

\(3\) An effect whose severity falls between those effects covered in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section will be regarded as a major engine effect.

\[Amdt. 33-24, 72 FR 50867, Sept. 4, 2007\]

### §33.76   Bird ingestion.

\(a\) *General.* Compliance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be in accordance with the following:

\(1\) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, all ingestion tests must be conducted with the engine stabilized at no less than 100-percent takeoff power or thrust, for test day ambient conditions prior to the ingestion. In addition, the demonstration of compliance must account for engine operation at sea level takeoff conditions on the hottest day that a minimum engine can achieve maximum rated takeoff thrust or power.

\(2\) The engine inlet throat area as used in this section to determine the bird quantity and weights will be established by the applicant and identified as a limitation in the installation instructions required under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.5   Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine.\|§33.5]].

\(3\) The impact to the front of the engine from the large single bird, the single largest medium bird which can enter the inlet, and the large flocking bird must be evaluated. Applicants must show that the associated components when struck under the conditions prescribed in paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable, will not affect the engine to the extent that the engine cannot comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3), (c)(6) and (d)(4) of this section.

\(4\) For an engine that incorporates an inlet protection device, compliance with this section shall be established with the device functioning. The engine approval will be endorsed to show that compliance with the requirements has been established with the device functioning.

\(5\) Objects that are accepted by the Administrator may be substituted for birds when conducting the bird ingestion tests required by paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section.

\(6\) If compliance with the requirements of this section is not established, the engine type certification documentation will show that the engine shall be limited to aircraft installations in which it is shown that a bird cannot strike the engine, or be ingested into the engine, or adversely restrict airflow into the engine.

\(b\) *Large single bird.* Compliance with the large bird ingestion requirements shall be in accordance with the following:

\(1\) The large bird ingestion test shall be conducted using one bird of a weight determined from Table 1 aimed at the most critical exposed location on the first stage rotor blades and ingested at a bird speed of 200-knots for engines to be installed on airplanes, or the maximum airspeed for normal rotorcraft flight operations for engines to be installed on rotorcraft.

\(2\) Power lever movement is not permitted within 15 seconds following ingestion of the large bird.

\(3\) Ingestion of a single large bird tested under the conditions prescribed in this section may not result in any condition described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.75   Safety analysis.\|§33.75]](g)(2) of this part.

\(4\) Compliance with the large bird ingestion requirements of this paragraph may be shown by demonstrating that the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.94   Blade containment and rotor unbalance tests.\|§33.94]](a) constitute a more severe demonstration of blade containment and rotor unbalance than the requirements of this paragraph.

\(c\) *Small and medium flocking bird.* Compliance with the small and medium bird ingestion requirements shall be in accordance with the following:

\(1\) Analysis or component test, or both, acceptable to the Administrator, shall be conducted to determine the critical ingestion parameters affecting power loss and damage. Critical ingestion parameters shall include, but are not limited to, the effects of bird speed, critical target location, and first stage rotor speed. The critical bird ingestion speed should reflect the most critical condition within the range of airspeeds used for normal flight operations up to 1,500 feet above ground level, but not less than V1 minimum for airplanes.

\(2\) Medium bird engine tests shall be conducted so as to simulate a flock encounter, and will use the bird weights and quantities specified in Table 2. When only one bird is specified, that bird will be aimed at the engine core primary flow path; the other critical locations on the engine face area must be addressed, as necessary, by appropriate tests or analysis, or both. When two or more birds are specified in Table 2, the largest of those birds must be aimed at the engine core primary flow path, and a second bird must be aimed at the most critical exposed location on the first stage rotor blades. Any remaining birds must be evenly distributed over the engine face area.

\(3\) In addition, except for rotorcraft engines, it must also be substantiated by appropriate tests or analysis or both, that when the full fan assembly is subjected to the ingestion of the quantity and weights of bird from Table 3, aimed at the fan assembly's most critical location outboard of the primary core flowpath, and in accordance with the applicable test conditions of this paragraph, that the engine can comply with the acceptance criteria of this paragraph.

\(4\) A small bird ingestion test is not required if the prescribed number of medium birds pass into the engine rotor blades during the medium bird test.

\(5\) Small bird ingestion tests shall be conducted so as to simulate a flock encounter using one 85 gram (0.187 lb.) bird for each 0.032 square-meter (49.6 square-inches) of inlet area, or fraction thereof, up to a maximum of 16 birds. The birds will be aimed so as to account for any critical exposed locations on the first stage rotor blades, with any remaining birds evenly distributed over the engine face area.

\(6\) Ingestion of small and medium birds tested under the conditions prescribed in this paragraph may not cause any of the following:

\(i\) More than a sustained 25-percent power or thrust loss;

\(ii\) The engine to be shut down during the required run-on demonstration prescribed in paragraphs (c)(7) or (c)(8) of this section;

\(iii\) The conditions defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

\(iv\) Unacceptable deterioration of engine handling characteristics.

\(7\) Except for rotorcraft engines, the following test schedule shall be used:

\(i\) Ingestion so as to simulate a flock encounter, with approximately 1 second elapsed time from the moment of the first bird ingestion to the last.

\(ii\) Followed by 2 minutes without power lever movement after the ingestion.

### §33.78   Rain and hail ingestion.

\(a\) *All engines.* (1) The ingestion of large hailstones (0.8 to 0.9 specific gravity) at the maximum true air speed, up to 15,000 feet (4,500 meters), associated with a representative aircraft operating in rough air, with the engine at maximum continuous power, may not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss after the ingestion, or require the engine to be shut down. One-half the number of hailstones shall be aimed randomly over the inlet face area and the other half aimed at the critical inlet face area. The hailstones shall be ingested in a rapid sequence to simulate a hailstone encounter and the number and size of the hailstones shall be determined as follows:

\(i\) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) diameter hailstone for engines with inlet areas of not more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters).

\(ii\) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) diameter and one 2-inch (50 millimeters) diameter hailstone for each 150 square inches (0.0968 square meters) of inlet area, or fraction thereof, for engines with inlet areas of more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters).

\(2\) In addition to complying with paragraph (a)(1) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable operation throughout its specified operating envelope when subjected to sudden encounters with the certification standard concentrations of rain and hail, as defined in appendix B to this part. Acceptable engine operation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability, during any three minute continuous period in rain and during any 30 second continuous period in hail. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies.

\(b\) *Engines for rotorcraft.* As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for rotorcraft turbine engines only, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable operation during and after the ingestion of rain with an overall ratio of water droplet flow to airflow, by weight, with a uniform distribution at the inlet plane, of at least four percent. Acceptable engine operation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power loss, or other adverse engine anomalies. The rain ingestion must occur under the following static ground level conditions:

\(1\) A normal stabilization period at take-off power without rain ingestion, followed immediately by the suddenly commencing ingestion of rain for three minutes at takeoff power, then

\(2\) Continuation of the rain ingestion during subsequent rapid deceleration to minimum idle, then

\(3\) Continuation of the rain ingestion during three minutes at minimum idle power to be certified for flight operation, then

\(4\) Continuation of the rain ingestion during subsequent rapid acceleration to takeoff power.

\(c\) *Engines for supersonic airplanes.* In addition to complying with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a separate test for supersonic airplane engines only, shall be conducted with three hailstones ingested at supersonic cruise velocity. These hailstones shall be aimed at the engine's critical face area, and their ingestion must not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss after the ingestion or require the engine to be shut down. The size of these hailstones shall be determined from the linear variation in diameter from 1-inch (25 millimeters) at 35,000 feet (10,500 meters) to 1⁄4 -inch (6 millimeters) at 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) using the diameter corresponding to the lowest expected supersonic cruise altitude. Alternatively, three larger hailstones may be ingested at subsonic velocities such that the kinetic energy of these larger hailstones is equivalent to the applicable supersonic ingestion conditions.

\(d\) For an engine that incorporates or requires the use of a protection device, demonstration of the rain and hail ingestion capabilities of the engine, as required in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, may be waived wholly or in part by the Administrator if the applicant shows that:

\(1\) The subject rain and hail constituents are of a size that will not pass through the protection device;

\(2\) The protection device will withstand the impact of the subject rain and hail constituents; and

\(3\) The subject of rain and hail constituents, stopped by the protection device, will not obstruct the flow of induction air into the engine, resulting in damage, power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies in excess of what would be accepted in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

### §33.79   Fuel burning thrust augmentor.

Each fuel burning thrust augmentor, including the nozzle, must—

\(a\) Provide cutoff of the fuel burning thrust augmentor;

\(b\) Permit on-off cycling;

\(c\) Be controllable within the intended range of operation;

\(d\) Upon a failure or malfunction of augmentor combustion, not cause the engine to lose thrust other than that provided by the augmentor; and

\(e\) Have controls that function compatibly with the other engine controls and automatically shut off augmentor fuel flow if the engine rotor speed drops below the minimum rotational speed at which the augmentor is intended to function.

## Subpart F—Block Tests; Turbine Aircraft Engines

### §33.81   Applicability.

This subpart prescribes the block tests and inspections for turbine engines.

\[Doc. No. 3025, 29 FR 7453, June 10, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 33-6, 39 FR 35468, Oct. 1, 1974\]

### §33.82   General.

Before each endurance test required by this subpart, the adjustment setting and functioning characteristic of each component having an adjustment setting and a functioning characteristic that can be established independent of installation on the engine must be established and recorded.

\[Amdt. 36-6, 39 FR 35468, Oct. 1, 1974\]

### §33.83   Vibration test.

\(a\) Each engine must undergo vibration surveys to establish that the vibration characteristics of those components that may be subject to mechanically or aerodynamically induced vibratory excitations are acceptable throughout the declared flight envelope. The engine surveys shall be based upon an appropriate combination of experience, analysis, and component test and shall address, as a minimum, blades, vanes, rotor discs, spacers, and rotor shafts.

\(b\) The surveys shall cover the ranges of power or thrust, and both the physical and corrected rotational speeds for each rotor system, corresponding to operations throughout the range of ambient conditions in the declared flight envelope, from the minimum rotational speed up to 103 percent of the maximum physical and corrected rotational speed permitted for rating periods of two minutes or longer, and up to 100 percent of all other permitted physical and corrected rotational speeds, including those that are overspeeds. If there is any indication of a stress peak arising at the highest of those required physical or corrected rotational speeds, the surveys shall be extended sufficiently to reveal the maximum stress values present, except that the extension need not cover more than a further 2 percentage points increase beyond those speeds.

\(c\) Evaluations shall be made of the following:

\(1\) The effects on vibration characteristics of operating with scheduled changes (including tolerances) to variable vane angles, compressor bleeds, accessory loading, the most adverse inlet air flow distortion pattern declared by the manufacturer, and the most adverse conditions in the exhaust duct(s); and

\(2\) The aerodynamic and aeromechanical factors which might induce or influence flutter in those systems susceptible to that form of vibration.

\(d\) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, the vibration stresses associated with the vibration characteristics determined under this section, when combined with the appropriate steady stresses, must be less than the endurance limits of the materials concerned, after making due allowances for operating conditions for the permitted variations in properties of the materials. The suitability of these stress margins must be justified for each part evaluated. If it is determined that certain operating conditions, or ranges, need to be limited, operating and installation limitations shall be established.

\(e\) The effects on vibration characteristics of excitation forces caused by fault conditions (such as, but not limited to, out-of balance, local blockage or enlargement of stator vane passages, fuel nozzle blockage, incorrectly schedule compressor variables, etc.) shall be evaluated by test or analysis, or by reference to previous experience and shall be shown not to create a hazardous condition.

\(f\) Compliance with this section shall be substantiated for each specific installation configuration that can affect the vibration characteristics of the engine. If these vibration effects cannot be fully investigated during engine certification, the methods by which they can be evaluated and methods by which compliance can be shown shall be substantiated and defined in the installation instructions required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.5   Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine.\|§33.5]].

\[Doc. No. 28107, 61 FR 28433, June 4, 1996, as amended by Amdt. 33-33, 77 FR 39624, July 5, 2012; 77 FR 58301, Sept. 20, 2012\]

### §33.84   Engine overtorque test.

\(a\) If approval of a maximum engine overtorque is sought for an engine incorporating a free power turbine, compliance with this section must be demonstrated by testing.

\(1\) The test may be run as part of the endurance test requirement of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.87   Endurance test.\|§33.87]]. Alternatively, tests may be performed on a complete engine or equivalent testing on individual groups of components.

\(2\) Upon conclusion of tests conducted to show compliance with this section, each engine part or individual groups of components must meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.93   Teardown inspection.\|§33.93]](a)(1) and (a)(2).

\(b\) The test conditions must be as follows:

\(1\) A total of 15 minutes run at the maximum engine overtorque to be approved. This may be done in separate runs, each being of at least 21⁄2 minutes duration.

\(2\) A power turbine rotational speed equal to the highest speed at which the maximum overtorque can occur in service. The test speed may not be more than the limit speed of take-off or OEI ratings longer than 2 minutes.

### §33.85   Calibration tests.

\(a\) Each engine must be subjected to those calibration tests necessary to establish its power characteristics and the conditions for the endurance test specified [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.87   Endurance test.\|§33.87]]. The results of the power characteristics calibration tests form the basis for establishing the characteristics of the engine over its entire operating range of speeds, pressures, temperatures, and altitudes. Power ratings are based upon standard atmospheric conditions with no airbleed for aircraft services and with only those accessories installed which are essential for engine functioning.

\(b\) A power check at sea level conditions must be accomplished on the endurance test engine after the endurance test and any change in power characteristics which occurs during the endurance test must be determined. Measurements taken during the final portion of the endurance test may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.

\(c\) In showing compliance with this section, each condition must stabilize before measurements are taken, except as permitted by paragraph (d) of this section.

\(d\) In the case of engines having 30-second OEI, and 2-minute OEI ratings, measurements taken during the applicable endurance test prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.87   Endurance test.\|§33.87]](f) (1) through (8) may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this section for these OEI ratings.

### §33.87   Endurance test.

\(a\) *General.* Each engine must be subjected to an endurance test that includes a total of at least 150 hours of operation and, depending upon the type and contemplated use of the engine, consists of one of the series of runs specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, as applicable. For engines tested under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) or (g) of this section, the prescribed 6-hour test sequence must be conducted 25 times to complete the required 150 hours of operation. Engines for which the 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings are desired must be further tested under paragraph (f) of this section. The following test requirements apply:

\(1\) The runs must be made in the order found appropriate by the FAA for the particular engine being tested.

\(2\) Any automatic engine control that is part of the engine must control the engine during the endurance test except for operations where automatic control is normally overridden by manual control or where manual control is otherwise specified for a particular test run.

\(3\) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, power or thrust, gas temperature, rotor shaft rotational speed, and, if limited, temperature of external surfaces of the engine must be at least 100 percent of the value associated with the particular engine operation being tested. More than one test may be run if all parameters cannot be held at the 100 percent level simultaneously.

\(4\) The runs must be made using fuel, lubricants and hydraulic fluid which conform to the specifications specified in complying with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.7   Engine ratings and operating limitations.\|§33.7]](c).

\(5\) Maximum air bleed for engine and aircraft services must be used during at least one-fifth of the runs, except for the test required under paragraph (f) of this section, provided the validity of the test is not compromised. However, for these runs, the power or thrust or the rotor shaft rotational speed may be less than 100 percent of the value associated with the particular operation being tested if the FAA finds that the validity of the endurance test is not compromised.

\(6\) Each accessory drive and mounting attachment must be loaded in accordance with paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, except as permitted by paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section for the test required under paragraph (f) of this section.

\(i\) The load imposed by each accessory used only for aircraft service must be the limit load specified by the applicant for the engine drive and attachment point during rated maximum continuous power or thrust and higher output.

\(ii\) The endurance test of any accessory drive and mounting attachment under load may be accomplished on a separate rig if the validity of the test is confirmed by an approved analysis.

\(iii\) The applicant is not required to load the accessory drives and mounting attachments when running the tests under paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(8) of this section if the applicant can substantiate that there is no significant effect on the durability of any accessory drive or engine component. However, the applicant must add the equivalent engine output power extraction from the power turbine rotor assembly to the engine shaft output.

\(7\) During the runs at any rated power or thrust the gas temperature and the oil inlet temperature must be maintained at the limiting temperature except where the test periods are not longer than 5 minutes and do not allow stabilization. At least one run must be made with fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid at the minimum pressure limit and at least one run must be made with fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid at the maximum pressure limit with fluid temperature reduced as necessary to allow maximum pressure to be attained.

\(8\) If the number of occurrences of either transient rotor shaft overspeed, transient gas overtemperature or transient engine overtorque is limited, that number of the accelerations required by paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section must be made at the limiting overspeed, overtemperature or overtorque. If the number of occurrences is not limited, half the required accelerations must be made at the limiting overspeed, overtemperature or overtorque.

\(9\) For each engine type certificated for use on supersonic aircraft the following additional test requirements apply:

\(i\) To change the thrust setting, the power control lever must be moved from the initial position to the final position in not more than one second except for movements into the fuel burning thrust augmentor augmentation position if additional time to confirm ignition is necessary.

\(ii\) During the runs at any rated augmented thrust the hydraulic fluid temperature must be maintained at the limiting temperature except where the test periods are not long enough to allow stabilization.

\(iii\) During the simulated supersonic runs the fuel temperature and induction air temperature may not be less than the limiting temperature.

\(iv\) The endurance test must be conducted with the fuel burning thrust augmentor installed, with the primary and secondary exhaust nozzles installed, and with the variable area exhaust nozzles operated during each run according to the methods specified in complying with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.5   Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine.\|§33.5]](b).

\(v\) During the runs at thrust settings for maximum continuous thrust and percentages thereof, the engine must be operated with the inlet air distortion at the limit for those thrust settings.

\(b\) *Engines other than certain rotorcraft engines.* For each engine except a rotorcraft engine for which a rating is desired under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, the applicant must conduct the following runs:

\(1\) *Takeoff and idling.* One hour of alternate five-minute periods at rated takeoff power or thrust and at idling power or thrust. The developed powers or thrusts at takeoff and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature conditions must be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule established by the applicant. The applicant may, during any one period, manually control the rotor speed, power, or thrust while taking data to check performance. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at takeoff must be at the augmented rating. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that do not materially increase operating severity, the amount of running conducted at the augmented rating is determined by the FAA. In changing the power setting after each period, the power-control lever must be moved in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

\(2\) *Rated maximum continuous and takeoff power or thrust.* Thirty minutes at—

\(i\) Rated maximum continuous power or thrust during fifteen of the twenty-five 6-hour endurance test cycles; and

\(ii\) Rated takeoff power or thrust during ten of the twenty-five 6-hour endurance test cycles.

\(4\) *Incremental cruise power or thrust.* Two hours and 30 minutes at the successive power lever positions corresponding to at least 15 approximately equal speed and time increments between maximum continuous engine rotational speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For engines operating at constant speed, the thrust and power may be varied in place of speed. If there is significant peak vibration anywhere between ground idle and maximum continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen may be changed to increase the amount of running made while subject to the peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent in incremental running.

\(5\) *Acceleration and deceleration runs.* 30 minutes of accelerations and decelerations, consisting of six cycles from idling power or thrust to rated takeoff power or thrust and maintained at the takeoff power lever position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for approximately four and one-half minutes. In complying with this paragraph, the power-control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the other in not more than one second, except that, if different regimes of control operations are incorporated necessitating scheduling of the power-control lever motion in going from one extreme position to the other, a longer period of time is acceptable, but not more than two seconds.

\(6\) *Starts.* One hundred starts must be made, of which 25 starts must be preceded by at least a two-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false engine starts, pausing for the applicant's specified minimum fuel drainage time, before attempting a normal start.

\(1\) *Takeoff and idling.* One hour of alternate 5-minute periods at rated takeoff power and at idling power. The developed powers at takeoff and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature conditions must be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule established by the applicant.

For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power must be at the augmented power rating. In changing the power setting after each period, the power control lever must be moved in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.

\(5\) *Incremental cruise power.* Two hours and 30 minutes at the successive power lever positions corresponding with not less than 15 approximately equal speed and time increments between maximum continuous engine rotational speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For engines operating at constant speed, power may be varied in place of speed. If there are significant peak vibrations anywhere between ground idle and maximum continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen must be changed to increase the amount of running conducted while subject to peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent in incremental running.

\(6\) *Acceleration and deceleration runs.* Thirty minutes of accelerations and decelerations, consisting of six cycles from idling power to rated takeoff power and maintained at the takeoff power lever position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for approximately 41⁄2 minutes. In complying with this paragraph, the power control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the other in not more than one second. If, however, different regimes of control operations are incorporated that necessitate scheduling of the power control lever motion from one extreme position to the other, then a longer period of time is acceptable, but not more than two seconds.

\(7\) *Starts.* One hundred starts, of which 25 starts must be preceded by at least a two-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false engine starts, pausing for the applicant's specified minimum fuel drainage time, before attempting a normal start. There must be at least 10 normal restarts not more than 15 minutes after engine shutdown. The remaining starts may be made after completing the 150 hours of endurance testing.

\(d\) *Rotorcraft engines for which a continuous OEI rating is desired.* For each rotorcraft engine for which a continuous OEI power rating is desired, the applicant must conduct the following series of tests:

\(1\) *Takeoff and idling.* One hour of alternate 5-minute periods at rated takeoff power and at idling power. The developed powers at takeoff and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature conditions must be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule established by the applicant. During any one period the rotor speed and power may be controlled manually while taking data to check performance. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power must be at the augmented power rating.

\(4\) *Rated maximum continuous power.* One hour at rated maximum continuous power.

\(5\) *Incremental cruise power.* Two hours at the successive power lever positions corresponding with not less than 12 approximately equal speed and time increments between maximum continuous engine rotational speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For engines operating at constant speed, power may be varied in place of speed. If there are significant peak vibrations anywhere between ground idle and maximum continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen must be changed to increase the amount of running conducted while being subjected to the peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent in incremental running.

\(6\) *Acceleration and deceleration runs.* Thirty minutes of accelerations and decelerations, consisting of six cycles from idling power to rated takeoff power and maintained at the takeoff power lever position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for approximately 41⁄2 minutes.

\(1\) *Takeoff, 21⁄2 -minute OEI, and idling.* One hour of alternate 5-minute periods at rated takeoff power and at idling power except that, during the third and sixth takeoff power periods, only 21⁄2 minutes need be conducted at rated takeoff power, and the remaining 21⁄2 minutes must be conducted at rated 21⁄2 -minute OEI power. The developed powers at takeoff, 21⁄2 -minute OEI, and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature conditions must be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule established by the applicant. The applicant may, during any one period, control manually the rotor speed and power while taking data to check performance. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power must be at the augmented rating. In changing the power setting after or during each period, the power control lever must be moved in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(5), (c)(6), or (d)(6) of this section, as applicable.

## Subpart G—Special Requirements: Turbine Aircraft Engines

### §33.201   Design and test requirements for Early ETOPS eligibility.

An applicant seeking type design approval for an engine to be installed on a two-engine airplane approved for ETOPS without the service experience specified in part 25, appendix K, K25.2.1 of this chapter, must comply with the following:

\(a\) The engine must be designed using a design quality process acceptable to the FAA, that ensures the design features of the engine minimize the occurrence of failures, malfunctions, defects, and maintenance errors that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss.

\(b\) The design features of the engine must address problems shown to result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss in the applicant's other relevant type designs approved within the past 10 years, to the extent that adequate service data is available within that 10-year period. An applicant without adequate service data must show experience with and knowledge of problem mitigating design practices equivalent to that gained from actual service experience in a manner acceptable to the FAA.

\(c\) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, the applicant must conduct a simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test in accordance with an approved test plan on an engine that substantially conforms to the type design. The test must:

\(1\) Include a minimum of 3,000 representative service start-stop mission cycles and three simulated diversion cycles at maximum continuous thrust or power for the maximum diversion time for which ETOPS eligibility is sought. Each start-stop mission cycle must include the use of take-off, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing thrust or power and the use of thrust reverse (if applicable). The diversions must be evenly distributed over the duration of the test. The last diversion must be conducted within 100 cycles of the completion of the test.

\(2\) Be performed with the high speed and low speed main engine rotors independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended field service maintenance vibration levels. For engines with three main engine rotors, the intermediate speed rotor must be independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended production acceptance vibration level. The required peak vibration levels must be verified during a slow acceleration and deceleration run of the test engine covering the main engine rotor operating speed ranges.

\(3\) Include a minimum of three million vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the typical high-speed rotor start-stop mission cycle. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the typical service start-stop cycle speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm, the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to ten million cycles for a 200 rpm incremental step.

\(4\) Include a minimum of 300,000 vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the high-speed rotor approved operational speed range between minimum flight idle and cruise power not covered by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the applicable speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to 1 million for a 200 rpm incremental step.

\(5\) Include vibration surveys at periodic intervals throughout the test. The equivalent value of the peak vibration level observed during the surveys must meet the minimum vibration requirement of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.201   Design and test requirements for Early ETOPS eligibility.\|§33.201]](c)(2).

\(d\) Prior to the test required by paragraph (c) of this section, the engine must be subjected to a calibration test to document power and thrust characteristics.

\(e\) At the conclusion of the testing required by paragraph (c) of this section, the engine must:

\(1\) Be subjected to a calibration test at sea-level conditions. Any change in power or thrust characteristics must be within approved limits.

\(2\) Be visually inspected in accordance with the on-wing inspection recommendations and limits contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness submitted in compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.4   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§33.4]].

\(3\) Be completely disassembled and inspected—

\(i\) In accordance with the applicable inspection recommendations and limits contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness submitted in compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.4   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§33.4]];

\(ii\) With consideration of the causes of IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss identified by paragraph (b) of this section; and

\(iii\) In a manner to identify wear or distress conditions that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss not specifically identified by paragraph (b) of this section or addressed within the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.

\(4\) Not show wear or distress to the extent that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss within a period of operation before the component, assembly, or system would likely have been inspected or functionally tested for integrity while in service. Such wear or distress must have corrective action implemented through a design change, a change to maintenance instructions, or operational procedures before ETOPS eligibility is granted. The type and frequency of wear and distress that occurs during the engine test must be consistent with the type and frequency of wear and distress that would be expected to occur on ETOPS eligible engines.

\(f\) An alternative mission cycle endurance test that provides an equivalent demonstration of the unbalance and vibration specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be used when approved by the FAA.

\(g\) For an applicant using the simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test to comply with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.90   Initial maintenance inspection test.\|§33.90]], the test may be interrupted so that the engine may be inspected by an on-wing or other method, using criteria acceptable to the FAA, after completion of the test cycles required to comply with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.90   Initial maintenance inspection test.\|§33.90]](a). Following the inspection, the ETOPS test must be resumed to complete the requirements of this section.

Within the envelope, total water content (TWC) in g/m3 has been determined based upon the adiabatic lapse defined by the convective rise of 90% relative humidity air from sea level to higher altitudes and scaled by a factor of 0.65 to a standard cloud length of 17.4 nautical miles. Figure D2 of this Appendix displays TWC for this distance over a range of ambient temperature within the boundaries of the ice crystal envelope specified in Figure D1 of this Appendix.

Ice crystal size median mass dimension (MMD) range is 50-200 microns (equivalent spherical size) based upon measurements near convective storm cores.

The TWC can be treated as completely glaciated (ice crystal) except as noted in the Table 1 of this Appendix.

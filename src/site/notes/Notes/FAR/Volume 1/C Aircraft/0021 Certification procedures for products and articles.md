### Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 88—Fuel Tank System Fault Tolerance Evaluation Requirements

1\. *Applicability.* This SFAR applies to the holders of type certificates, and supplemental type certificates that may affect the airplane fuel tank system, for turbine-powered transport category airplanes, provided the type certificate was issued after January 1, 1958, and the airplane has either a maximum type certificated passenger capacity of 30 or more, or a maximum type certificated payload capacity of 7,500 pounds or more. This SFAR also applies to applicants for type certificates, amendments to a type certificate, and supplemental type certificates affecting the fuel tank systems for those airplanes identified above, if the application was filed before June 6, 2001, the effective date of this SFAR, and the certificate was not issued before June 6, 2001.

2\. *Compliance:* Each type certificate holder, and each supplemental type certificate holder of a modification affecting the airplane fuel tank system, must accomplish the following within the compliance times specified in paragraph (e) of this section:

\(a\) Conduct a safety review of the airplane fuel tank system to determine that the design meets the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.901   Installation.\|§§25.901]] and 25.981(a) and (b) of this chapter. If the current design does not meet these requirements, develop all design changes to the fuel tank system that are necessary to meet these requirements. The responsible Aircraft Certification Service office for the affected airplane may grant an extension of the 18-month compliance time for development of design changes if:

\(1\) The safety review is completed within the compliance time;

\(2\) Necessary design changes are identified within the compliance time; and

\(3\) Additional time can be justified, based on the holder's demonstrated aggressiveness in performing the safety review, the complexity of the necessary design changes, the availability of interim actions to provide an acceptable level of safety, and the resulting level of safety.

\(b\) Develop all maintenance and inspection instructions necessary to maintain the design features required to preclude the existence or development of an ignition source within the fuel tank system of the airplane.

\(c\) Submit a report for approval to the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office for the affected airplane, that:

\(1\) Provides substantiation that the airplane fuel tank system design, including all necessary design changes, meets the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.901   Installation.\|§§25.901]] and 25.981(a) and (b) of this chapter; and

\(2\) Contains all maintenance and inspection instructions necessary to maintain the design features required to preclude the existence or development of an ignition source within the fuel tank system throughout the operational life of the airplane.

\(d\) The responsible Aircraft Certification Service office for the affected airplane, may approve a report submitted in accordance with paragraph 2(c) if it determines that any provisions of this SFAR not complied with are compensated for by factors that provide an equivalent level of safety.

\(e\) Each type certificate holder must comply no later than December 6, 2002, or within 18 months after the issuance of a type certificate for which application was filed before June 6, 2001, whichever is later; and each supplemental type certificate holder of a modification affecting the airplane fuel tank system must comply no later than June 6, 2003, or within 18 months after the issuance of a supplemental type certificate for which application was filed before June 6, 2001, whichever is later.

## Subpart D—Changes to Type Certificates

### §21.91   Applicability.

This subpart prescribes procedural requirements for the approval of changes to type certificates.

### §21.93   Classification of changes in type design.

\(a\) In addition to changes in type design specified in paragraph (b) of this section, changes in type design are classified as minor and major. A “minor change” is one that has no appreciable effect on the weight, balance, structural strength, reliability, operational characteristics, or other characteristics affecting the airworthiness of the product. All other changes are “major changes” (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).

\(b\) For the purpose of complying with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0036 Noise standards  aircraft type and airworthiness certification\|Part 36 of this chapter]], and except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, any voluntary change in the type design of an aircraft that may increase the noise levels of that aircraft is an “acoustical change” (in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph (a) of this section) for the following aircraft:

\(1\) Transport category large airplanes.

\(2\) Jet (Turbojet powered) airplanes (regardless of category). For airplanes to which this paragraph applies, “acoustical changes” do not include changes in type design that are limited to one of the following—

\(i\) Gear down flight with one or more retractable landing gear down during the entire flight, or

\(ii\) Spare engine and nacelle carriage external to the skin of the airplane (and return of the pylon or other external mount), or

\(iii\) Time-limited engine and/or nacelle changes, where the change in type design specifies that the airplane may not be operated for a period of more than 90 days unless compliance with the applicable acoustical change provisions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0036 Noise standards  aircraft type and airworthiness certification\|Part 36 of this chapter]] is shown for that change in type design.

\(3\) Propeller driven commuter category and small airplanes in the primary, normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, and restricted categories, except for airplanes that are:

\(i\) Designated for “agricultural aircraft operations” (as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0137 Agricultural aircraft operations#§137.3   Definition of terms.\|§137.3]] of this chapter, effective January 1, 1966) to which [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0036 Noise standards  aircraft type and airworthiness certification#§36.1583   Noncomplying agricultural and fire fighting airplanes.\|§36.1583]] of this chapter does not apply, or

\(ii\) Designated for dispensing fire fighting materials to which [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0036 Noise standards  aircraft type and airworthiness certification#§36.1583   Noncomplying agricultural and fire fighting airplanes.\|§36.1583]] of this chapter does not apply, or

\(iii\) U.S. registered, and that had flight time prior to January 1, 1955 or

\(iv\) Land configured aircraft reconfigured with floats or skis. This reconfiguration does not permit further exception from the requirements of this section upon any acoustical change not enumerated in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0021 Certification procedures for products and articles#§21.93   Classification of changes in type design.\|§21.93]](b).

\(4\) Helicopters except:

\(i\) Those helicopters that are designated exclusively:

\(A\) For “agricultural aircraft operations”, as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0137 Agricultural aircraft operations#§137.3   Definition of terms.\|§137.3]] of this chapter, as effective on January 1, 1966;

\(B\) For dispensing fire fighting materials; or

\(C\) For carrying external loads, as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0133 Rotorcraft external-load operations#§133.1   Applicability.\|§133.1]](b) of this chapter, as effective on December 20, 1976.

\(ii\) Those helicopters modified by installation or removal of external equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, “external equipment” means any instrument, mechanism, part, apparatus, appurtenance, or accessory that is attached to, or extends from, the helicopter exterior but is not used nor is intended to be used in operating or controlling a helicopter in flight and is not part of an airframe or engine. An “acoustical change” does not include:

\(A\) Addition or removal of external equipment;

\(B\) Changes in the airframe made to accommodate the addition or removal of external equipment, to provide for an external load attaching means, to facilitate the use of external equipment or external loads, or to facilitate the safe operation of the helicopter with external equipment mounted to, or external loads carried by, the helicopter;

\(C\) Reconfiguration of the helicopter by the addition or removal of floats and skis;

\(D\) Flight with one or more doors and/or windows removed or in an open position; or

\(E\) Any changes in the operational limitations placed on the helicopter as a consequence of the addition or removal of external equipment, floats, and skis, or flight operations with doors and/or windows removed or in an open position.

\(5\) Tiltrotors.

\(c\) For purposes of complying with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0034 Fuel venting and exhaust emission requirements for turbine engine powered airplanes\|part 34 of this chapter]], any voluntary change in the type design of the airplane or engine which may increase fuel venting or exhaust emissions is an “emissions change.”

\(2\) Show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the applicable requirements of this subchapter, and provide the FAA the means by which such compliance has been shown; and

\(3\) Provide a statement certifying that the applicant has complied with the applicable requirements.

\(b\) Approval of a major change in the type design of an aircraft engine is limited to the specific engine configuration upon which the change is made unless the applicant identifies in the necessary descriptive data for inclusion in the type design the other configurations of the same engine type for which approval is requested and shows that the change is compatible with the other configurations.

\[Amdt. 21-40, 39 FR 35459, Oct. 1, 1974, as amended by Amdt. 21-92, 74 FR 53387, Oct. 16, 2009; Amdt. 21-96, 77 FR 71695, Dec. 4, 2012\]

### §21.99   Required design changes.

\(a\) When an Airworthiness Directive is issued under Part 39 the holder of the type certificate for the product concerned must—

\(1\) If the FAA finds that design changes are necessary to correct the unsafe condition of the product, and upon his request, submit appropriate design changes for approval; and

\(2\) Upon approval of the design changes, make available the descriptive data covering the changes to all operators of products previously certificated under the type certificate.

\(b\) In a case where there are no current unsafe conditions, but the FAA or the holder of the type certificate finds through service experience that changes in type design will contribute to the safety of the product, the holder of the type certificate may submit appropriate design changes for approval. Upon approval of the changes, the manufacturer must make information on the design changes available to all operators of the same type of product.

\[Doc. No. 5085, 29 FR 14567, Oct. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 21-3, 30 FR 8826, July 24, 1965\]

### §21.101   Designation of applicable regulations.

\(a\) An applicant for a change to a type certificate must show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change and with parts 34 and 36 of this chapter. Exceptions are detailed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

\(b\) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section apply, an applicant may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with an earlier amendment of a regulation required by paragraph (a) of this section, and of any other regulation the FAA finds is directly related. However, the earlier amended regulation may not precede either the corresponding regulation included by reference in the type certificate, or any regulation in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.2   Special retroactive requirements.\|§§25.2]], 27.2, or 29.2 of this chapter that is related to the change. The applicant may show compliance with an earlier amendment of a regulation for any of the following:

\(1\) A change that the FAA finds not to be significant. In determining whether a specific change is significant, the FAA considers the change in context with all previous relevant design changes and all related revisions to the applicable regulations incorporated in the type certificate for the product. Changes that meet one of the following criteria are automatically considered significant:

\(i\) The general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained.

\(ii\) The assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.

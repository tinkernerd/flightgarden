This section also applies to transport category, turbine-powered airplanes with a type certificate issued after January 1, 1958, if a design change approval for which application is made after January 14, 2011 has the effect of reducing the maximum takeoff gross weight from greater than 75,000 pounds to 75,000 pounds or less.

\(b\) *Limit of validity.* Each person identified in paragraph (c) of this section must comply with the following requirements:

\(1\) Establish a limit of validity of the engineering data that supports the structural maintenance program (hereafter referred to as LOV) that corresponds to the period of time, stated as a number of total accumulated flight cycles or flight hours or both, during which it is demonstrated that widespread fatigue damage will not occur in the airplane. This demonstration must include an evaluation of airplane structural configurations and be supported by test evidence and analysis at a minimum and, if available, service experience, or service experience and teardown inspection results, of high-time airplanes of similar structural design, accounting for differences in operating conditions and procedures. The airplane structural configurations to be evaluated include—

\(i\) All model variations and derivatives approved under the type certificate; and

\(ii\) All structural modifications to and replacements for the airplane structural configurations specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, mandated by airworthiness directives as of January 14, 2011.

\(2\) If the LOV depends on performance of maintenance actions for which service information has not been mandated by airworthiness directive as of January 14, 2011, submit the following to the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office:

\(i\) For those maintenance actions for which service information has been issued as of the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (c) of this section, a list identifying each of those actions.

\(ii\) For those maintenance actions for which service information has not been issued as of the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (c) of this section, a list identifying each of those actions and a binding schedule for providing in a timely manner the necessary service information for those actions.

## Subpart E—Aging Airplane Safety—Damage Tolerance Data for Repairs and Alterations

### §26.41   Definitions.

*Affects (or Affected)* means structure has been physically repaired, altered, or modified, or the structural loads acting on the structure have been increased or redistributed.

*Baseline structure* means structure that is designed under the original type certificate or amended type certificate for that airplane model.

*Damage Tolerance Evaluation (DTE)* means a process that leads to a determination of maintenance actions necessary to detect or preclude fatigue cracking that could contribute to a catastrophic failure. As applied to repairs and alterations, a DTE includes the evaluation both of the repair or alteration and of the fatigue critical structure affected by the repair or alteration.

*Damage Tolerance Inspection (DTI)* means the inspection developed as a result of a DTE. A DTI includes the areas to be inspected, the inspection method, the inspection procedures, including acceptance and rejection criteria, the threshold, and any repeat intervals associated with those inspections. The DTI may specify a time limit when a repair or alteration needs to be replaced or modified. If the DTE concludes that DT-based supplemental structural inspections are not necessary, the DTI contains a statement to that effect.

*DT data* mean DTE documentation and the DTI.

*DTE documentation* means data that identify the evaluated fatigue critical structure, the basic assumptions applied in a DTE, and the results of a DTE.

*Fatigue critical structure* means airplane structure that is susceptible to fatigue cracking that could contribute to a catastrophic failure, as determined in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.571   Damage—tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.\|§25.571]] of this chapter. Fatigue critical structure includes structure, which, if repaired or altered, could be susceptible to fatigue cracking and contribute to a catastrophic failure. Such structure may be part of the baseline structure or part of an alteration.

*Implementation schedule* consists of documentation that establishes the timing for accomplishing the necessary actions for developing DT data for repairs and alterations, and for incorporating those data into an operator's continuing airworthiness maintenance program. The documentation must identify times when actions must be taken as specific numbers of airplane flight hours, flight cycles, or both.

*Published repair data* mean instructions for accomplishing repairs, which are published for general use in structural repair manuals and service bulletins (or equivalent types of documents).

### §26.43   Holders of and applicants for type certificates—Repairs.

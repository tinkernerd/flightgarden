### Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 13

1\. *Applicability.* Contrary provisions of the Civil Air Regulations regarding certification notwithstanding,1 this regulation shall provide the basis for approval by the Administrator of modifications of individual Douglas DC-3 and Lockheed L-18 airplanes subsequent to the effective date of this regulation.

<div>

1It is not intended to waive compliance with such airworthiness requirements as are included in the operating parts of the Civil Air Regulations for specific types of operation.

</div>

2\. *General modifications.* Except as modified in sections 3 and 4 of this regulation, an applicant for approval of modifications to a DC-3 or L-18 airplane which result in changes in design or in changes to approved limitations shall show that the modifications were accomplished in accordance with the rules of either Part 4a or Part 4b in effect on September 1, 1953, which are applicable to the modification being made: *Provided,* That an applicant may elect to accomplish a modification in accordance with the rules of Part 4b in effect on the date of application for the modification in lieu of Part 4a or Part 4b as in effect on September 1, 1953: *And provided further,* That each specific modification must be accomplished in accordance with all of the provisions contained in the elected rules relating to the particular modification.

3\. *Specific conditions for approval.* An applicant for any approval of the following specific changes shall comply with section 2 of this regulation as modified by the applicable provisions of this section.

\(a\) *Increase in take-off power limitation—1,200 to 1,350 horsepower.* The engine take-off power limitation for the airplane may be increased to more than 1,200 horsepower but not to more than 1,350 horsepower per engine if the increase in power does not adversely affect the flight characteristics of the airplane.

\(b\) *Increase in take-off power limitation to more than 1,350 horsepower.* The engine take-off power limitation for the airplane may be increased to more than 1,350 horsepower per engine if compliance is shown with the flight characteristics and ground handling requirements of Part 4b.

\(c\) *Installation of engines of not more than 1,830 cubic inches displacement and not having a certificated take-off rating of more than 1,350 horsepower.* Engines of not more than 1,830 cubic inches displacement and not having a certificated take-off rating of more than 1,350 horsepower which necessitate a major modification of redesign of the engine installation may be installed, if the engine fire prevention and fire protection are equivalent to that on the prior engine installation.

\(d\) *Installation of engines of more than 1,830 cubic inches displacement or having certificated take-off rating of more than 1,350 horsepower.* Engines of more than 1,830 cubic inches displacement or having certificated take-off rating of more than 1,350 horsepower may be installed if compliance is shown with the engine installation requirements of Part 4b: *Provided,* That where literal compliance with the engine installation requirements of Part 4b is extremely difficult to accomplish and would not contribute materially to the objective sought, and the Administrator finds that the experience with the DC-3 or L-18 airplanes justifies it, he is authorized to accept such measures of compliance as he finds will effectively accomplish the basic objective.

4\. *Establishment of new maximum certificated weights.* An applicant for approval of new maximum certificated weights shall apply for an amendment of the airworthiness certificate of the airplane and shall show that the weights sought have been established, and the appropriate manual material obtained, as provided in this section.

<div>

Note: Transport category performance requirements result in the establishment of maximum certificated weights for various altitudes.

</div>

\(a\) *Weights-25,200 to 26,900 for the DC-3 and 18,500 to 19,500 for the L-18.* New maximum certificated weights of more than 25,200 but not more than 26,900 pounds for DC-3 and more than 18,500 but not more than 19,500 pounds for L-18 airplanes may be established in accordance with the transport category performance requirements of either Part 4a or Part 4b, if the airplane at the new maximum weights can meet the structural requirements of the elected part.

\[19 FR 5039, Aug. 11, 1954. Redesignated at 29 FR 19099, Dec. 30, 1964\]

### Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 109

1\. *Applicability.* Contrary provisions of 14 CFR parts 21, 25, and 119 of this chapter notwithstanding, an applicant is entitled to an amended type certificate or supplemental type certificate in the transport category, if the applicant complies with all applicable provisions of this SFAR.

### Operations

2\. *General.*

\(a\) The passenger capacity may not exceed 60. If more than 60 passenger seats are installed, then:

\(1\) If the extra seats are not suitable for occupancy during taxi, takeoff and landing, each extra seat must be clearly marked (e.g., a placard on the top of an armrest, or a placard sewn into the top of the back cushion) that the seat is not to be occupied during taxi, takeoff and landing.

\(2\) If the extra seats are suitable for occupancy during taxi, takeoff and landing (*i.e.,* meet all the strength and passenger injury criteria in part 25), then a note must be included in the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual that there are extra seats installed but that the number of passengers on the airplane must not exceed 60. Additionally, there must be a placard installed adjacent to each door that can be used as a passenger boarding door that states that the maximum passenger capacity is 60. The placard must be clearly legible to passengers entering the airplane.

\(b\) For airplanes outfitted with interior doors under paragraph 10 of this SFAR, the airplane flight manual (AFM) must include an appropriate limitation that the airplane must be staffed with at least the following number of flight attendants who meet the requirements of 14 CFR 91.533(b):

\(1\) The number of flight attendants required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules#§91.533   Flight attendant requirements.\|§91.533]](a)(1) and (2) of this chapter, and

\(2\) At least one flight attendant if the airplane model was originally certified for 75 passengers or more.

\(c\) The AFM must include appropriate limitation(s) to require a preflight passenger briefing describing the appropriate functions to be performed by the passengers and the relevant features of the airplane to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew.

\(d\) The airplane may not be offered for common carriage or operated for hire. The operating limitations section of the AFM must be revised to prohibit any operations involving the carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire. The operators may receive remuneration to the extent consistent with parts 125 and 91, subpart F, of this chapter.

\(e\) A placard stating that “Operations involving the carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire are prohibited,” must be located in the area of the Airworthiness Certificate holder at the entrance to the flightdeck.

\(f\) For passenger capacities of 45 to 60 passengers, analysis must be submitted that demonstrates that the airplane can be evacuated in less than 90 seconds under the conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.803   Emergency evacuation.\|§25.803]] and appendix J to part 25.

\(g\) In order for any airplane certified under this SFAR to be placed in part 135 or part 121 operations, the airplane must be brought back into full compliance with the applicable operational part.

### Equipment and Design

3\. *General.* Unless otherwise noted, compliance is required with the applicable certification basis for the airplane. Some provisions of this SFAR impose alternative requirements to certain airworthiness standards that do not apply to airplanes certificated to earlier standards. Those airplanes with an earlier certification basis are not required to comply with those alternative requirements.

4\. *Occupant Protection.*

\(a\) Firm Handhold. In lieu of the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.785   Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses.\|§25.785]](j), there must be means provided to enable persons to steady themselves in moderately rough air while occupying aisles that are along the cabin sidewall, or where practicable, bordered by seats (seat backs providing a 25-pound minimum breakaway force are an acceptable means of compliance).

\(b\) Injury criteria for multiple occupancy side-facing seats. The following requirements are only applicable to airplanes that are subject to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§25.562]].

\(1\) *Existing Criteria.* All injury protection criteria of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§25.562]](c)(1) through (c)(6) apply to the occupants of side-facing seating. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) assessments are only required for head contact with the seat and/or adjacent structures.

\(2\) *Body-to-Body Contact.* Contact between the head, pelvis, torso or shoulder area of one Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) with the head, pelvis, torso or shoulder area of the ATD in the adjacent seat is not allowed during the tests conducted in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§25.562]](b)(1) and (b)(2). Contact during rebound is allowed.

\(3\) *Thoracic Trauma.* If the torso of an ATD at the forward-most seat place impacts the seat and/or adjacent structure during testing, compliance with the Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI) injury criterion must be substantiated by dynamic test or by rational analysis based on previous test(s) of a similar seat installation. TTI data must be acquired with a Side Impact Dummy (SID), as defined by 49 CFR part 572, subpart F, or an equivalent ATD or a more appropriate ATD and must be processed as defined in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) part 571.214, section S6.13.5 (49 CFR 571.214). The TTI must be less than 85, as defined in 49 CFR part 572, subpart F. Torso contact during rebound is acceptable and need not be measured.

\(4\) *Pelvis.* If the pelvis of an ATD at any seat place impacts seat and/or adjacent structure during testing, pelvic lateral acceleration injury criteria must be substantiated by dynamic test or by rational analysis based on previous test(s) of a similar seat installation. Pelvic lateral acceleration may not exceed 130g. Pelvic acceleration data must be processed as defined in FMVSS part 571.214, section S6.13.5 (49 CFR 571.214).

\(5\) *Body-to-Wall/Furnishing Contact.* If the seat is installed aft of a structure—such as an interior wall or furnishing that may contact the pelvis, upper arm, chest, or head of an occupant seated next to the structure—the structure or a conservative representation of the structure and its stiffness must be included in the tests. It is recommended, but not required, that the contact surface of the actual structure be covered with at least two inches of energy absorbing protective padding (foam or equivalent) such as Ensolite.

\(6\) *Shoulder Strap Loads.* Where upper torso straps (shoulder straps) are used for sofa occupants, the tension loads in individual straps may not exceed 1,750 pounds. If dual straps are used for restraining the upper torso, the total strap tension loads may not exceed 2,000 pounds.

\(7\) *Occupant Retention.* All side-facing seats require end closures or other means to prevent the ATD's pelvis from translating beyond the end of the seat at any time during testing.

\(8\) *Test Parameters.*

\(i\) All seat positions need to be occupied by ATDs for the longitudinal tests.

\(ii\) A minimum of one longitudinal test, conducted in accordance with the conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§25.562]](b)(2), is required to assess the injury criteria as follows. Note that if a seat is installed aft of structure (such as an interior wall or furnishing) that does not have a homogeneous surface, an additional test or tests may be required to demonstrate that the injury criteria are met for the area which an occupant could contact. For example, different yaw angles could result in different injury considerations and may require separate tests to evaluate.

\(A\) For configurations without structure (such as a wall or bulkhead) installed directly forward of the forward seat place, Hybrid II ATDs or equivalent must be in all seat places.

\(B\) For configurations with structure (such as a wall or bulkhead) installed directly forward of the forward seat place, a side impact dummy or equivalent ATD or more appropriate ATD must be in the forward seat place and a Hybrid II ATD or equivalent must be in all other seat places.

\(C\) The test may be conducted with or without deformed floor.

\(D\) The test must be conducted with either no yaw or 10 degrees yaw for evaluating occupant injury. Deviating from the no yaw condition may not result in the critical area of contact not being evaluated. The upper torso restraint straps, where installed, must remain on the occupant's shoulder during the impact condition of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§25.562]](b)(2).

\(c\) For the vertical test, conducted in accordance with the conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§25.562]](b)(1), Hybrid II ATDs or equivalent must be used in all seat positions.

5\. *Direct View.* In lieu of the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.785   Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses.\|§25.785]](h)(2), to the extent practical without compromising proximity to a required floor level emergency exit, the majority of installed flight attendant seats must be located to face the cabin area for which the flight attendant is responsible.

6\. *Passenger Information Signs.* Compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.791   Passenger information signs and placards.\|§25.791]] is required except that for [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.791   Passenger information signs and placards.\|§25.791]](a), when smoking is to be prohibited, notification to the passengers may be provided by a single placard so stating, to be conspicuously located inside the passenger compartment, easily visible to all persons entering the cabin in the immediate vicinity of each passenger entry door.

7\. *Distance Between Exits.* For an airplane that is required to comply with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.807   Emergency exits.\|§25.807]](f)(4), in effect as of July 24, 1989, which has more than one passenger emergency exit on each side of the fuselage, no passenger emergency exit may be more than 60 feet from any adjacent passenger emergency exit on the same side of the same deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges, unless the following conditions are met:

\(a\) Each passenger seat must be located within 30 feet from the nearest exit on each side of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis, between the nearest exit edge and the front of the seat bottom cushion.

\(b\) The number of passenger seats located between two adjacent pairs of emergency exits (commonly referred to as a passenger zone) or between a pair of exits and a bulkhead or a compartment door (commonly referred to as a “dead-end zone”), may not exceed the following:

\(1\) For zones between two pairs of exits, 50 percent of the combined rated capacity of the two pairs of emergency exits.

\(2\) For zones between one pair of exits and a bulkhead, 40 percent of the rated capacity of the pair of emergency exits.

\(c\) The total number of passenger seats in the airplane may not exceed 33 percent of the maximum seating capacity for the airplane model using the exit ratings listed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.807   Emergency exits.\|§25.807]](g) for the original certified exits or the maximum allowable after modification when exits are deactivated, whichever is less.

\(d\) A distance of more than 60 feet between adjacent passenger emergency exits on the same side of the same deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges, is allowed only once on each side of the fuselage.

8\. *Emergency Exit Signs.* In lieu of the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.811   Emergency exit marking.\|§25.811]](d)(1) and (2) a single sign at each exit may be installed provided:

\(a\) The sign can be read from the aisle while directly facing the exit, and

\(b\) The sign can be read from the aisle adjacent to the passenger seat that is farthest from the exit and that does not have an intervening bulkhead/divider or exit.

9\. *Emergency Lighting.*

\(a\) *Exit Signs.* In lieu of the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]](b)(1), for airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 19 seats or less, the emergency exit signs required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.811   Emergency exit marking.\|§25.811]](d)(1), (2), and (3) must have red letters at least 1-inch high on a white background at least 2 inches high. These signs may be internally electrically illuminated, or self illuminated by other than electrical means, with an initial brightness of at least 160 microlamberts. The color may be reversed in the case of a sign that is self-illuminated by other than electrical means.

\(b\) *Floor Proximity Escape Path Marking.* In lieu of the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]](e)(1), for cabin seating compartments that do not have the main cabin aisle entering and exiting the compartment, the following are applicable:

\(1\) After a passenger leaves any passenger seat in the compartment, he/she must be able to exit the compartment to the main cabin aisle using only markings and visual features not more that 4 feet above the cabin floor, and

\(2\) Proceed to the exits using the marking system necessary to accomplish the actions in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]](e)(1) and (e)(2).

\(c\) *Transverse Separation of the Fuselage.* In the event of a transverse separation of the fuselage, compliance must be shown with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]](l) except as follows:

\(2\) For each airplane type originally type certificated with a maximum passenger seating capacity of 10 to 19, not more than 33 percent of all electrically illuminated emergency lights required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.812   Emergency lighting.\|§25.812]] may be rendered inoperative in addition to the lights that are directly damaged by the separation.

10\. *Interior doors.* In lieu of the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.813   Emergency exit access.\|§25.813]](e), interior doors may be installed between passenger seats and exits, provided the following requirements are met.

\(a\) Each door between any passenger seat, occupiable for taxi, takeoff, and landing, and any emergency exit must have a means to signal to the flightcrew, at the flightdeck, that the door is in the open position for taxi, takeoff and landing.

\(b\) Appropriate procedures/limitations must be established to ensure that any such door is in the open configuration for takeoff and landing.

\(c\) Each door between any passenger seat and any exit must have dual means to retain it in the open position, each of which is capable of reacting the inertia loads specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]].

\(d\) Doors installed across a longitudinal aisle must translate laterally to open and close, e.g., pocket doors.

\(e\) Each door between any passenger seat and any exit must be frangible in either direction.

\(f\) Each door between any passenger seat and any exit must be operable from either side, and if a locking mechanism is installed, it must be capable of being unlocked from either side without the use of special tools.

11\. *Width of Aisle.* Compliance is required with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.815   Width of aisle.\|§25.815]], except that aisle width may be reduced to 0 inches between passenger seats during in-flight operations only, provided that the applicant demonstrates that all areas of the cabin are easily accessible by a crew member in the event of an emergency (e.g., in-flight fire, decompression). Additionally, instructions must be provided at each passenger seat for restoring the aisle width required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.815   Width of aisle.\|§25.815]]. Procedures must be established and documented in the AFM to ensure that the required aisle widths are provided during taxi, takeoff, and landing.

12\. *Materials for Compartment Interiors.* Compliance is required with the applicable provisions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.853   Compartment interiors.\|§25.853]], except that compliance with appendix F, parts IV and V, to part 25, need not be demonstrated if it can be shown by test or a combination of test and analysis that the maximum time for evacuation of all occupants does not exceed 45 seconds under the conditions specified in appendix J to part 25.

13\. *Fire Detection.* For airplanes with a type certificated passenger capacity of 20 or more, there must be means that meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.858   Cargo or baggage compartment smoke or fire detection systems.\|§25.858]](a) through (d) to signal the flightcrew in the event of a fire in any isolated room not occupiable for taxi, takeoff and landing, which can be closed off from the rest of the cabin by a door. The indication must identify the compartment where the fire is located. This does not apply to lavatories, which continue to be governed by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.854   Lavatory fire protection.\|§25.854]].

14\. *Cooktops.* Each cooktop must be designed and installed to minimize any potential threat to the airplane, passengers, and crew. Compliance with this requirement must be found in accordance with the following criteria:

\(a\) Means, such as conspicuous burner-on indicators, physical barriers, or handholds, must be installed to minimize the potential for inadvertent personnel contact with hot surfaces of both the cooktop and cookware. Conditions of turbulence must be considered.

\(b\) Sufficient design means must be included to restrain cookware while in place on the cooktop, as well as representative contents, e.g., soup, sauces, etc., from the effects of flight loads and turbulence. Restraints must be provided to preclude hazardous movement of cookware and contents. These restraints must accommodate any cookware that is identified for use with the cooktop. Restraints must be designed to be easily utilized and effective in service. The cookware restraint system should also be designed so that it will not be easily disabled, thus rendering it unusable. Placarding must be installed which prohibits the use of cookware that cannot be accommodated by the restraint system.

\(c\) Placarding must be installed which prohibits the use of cooktops (i.e., power on any burner) during taxi, takeoff, and landing.

\(d\) Means must be provided to address the possibility of a fire occurring on or in the immediate vicinity of the cooktop. Two acceptable means of complying with this requirement are as follows:

\(1\) Placarding must be installed that prohibits any burner from being powered when the cooktop is unattended. (Note: This would prohibit a single person from cooking on the cooktop and intermittently serving food to passengers while any burner is powered.) A fire detector must be installed in the vicinity of the cooktop which provides an audible warning in the passenger cabin, and a fire extinguisher of appropriate size and extinguishing agent must be installed in the immediate vicinity of the cooktop. Access to the extinguisher may not be blocked by a fire on or around the cooktop.

\(2\) An automatic, thermally activated fire suppression system must be installed to extinguish a fire at the cooktop and immediately adjacent surfaces. The agent used in the system must be an approved total flooding agent suitable for use in an occupied area. The fire suppression system must have a manual override. The automatic activation of the fire suppression system must also automatically shut off power to the cooktop.

\(e\) The surfaces of the galley surrounding the cooktop which would be exposed to a fire on the cooktop surface or in cookware on the cooktop must be constructed of materials that comply with the flammability requirements of part III of appendix F to part 25. This requirement is in addition to the flammability requirements typically required of the materials in these galley surfaces. During the selection of these materials, consideration must also be given to ensure that the flammability characteristics of the materials will not be adversely affected by the use of cleaning agents and utensils used to remove cooking stains.

\(f\) The cooktop must be ventilated with a system independent of the airplane cabin and cargo ventilation system. Procedures and time intervals must be established to inspect and clean or replace the ventilation system to prevent a fire hazard from the accumulation of flammable oils and be included in the instructions for continued airworthiness. The ventilation system ducting must be protected by a flame arrestor. \[Note: The applicant may find additional useful information in Society of Automotive Engineers, Aerospace Recommended Practice 85, Rev. E, entitled “Air Conditioning Systems for Subsonic Airplanes,” dated August 1, 1991.\]

\(g\) Means must be provided to contain spilled foods or fluids in a manner that will prevent the creation of a slipping hazard to occupants and will not lead to the loss of structural strength due to airplane corrosion.

\(h\) Cooktop installations must provide adequate space for the user to immediately escape a hazardous cooktop condition.

\(i\) A means to shut off power to the cooktop must be provided at the galley containing the cooktop and in the cockpit. If additional switches are introduced in the cockpit, revisions to smoke or fire emergency procedures of the AFM will be required.

\(j\) If the cooktop is required to have a lid to enclose the cooktop there must be a means to automatically shut off power to the cooktop when the lid is closed.

15\. *Hand-Held Fire Extinguishers.*

\(a\) For airplanes that were originally type certificated with more than 60 passengers, the number of hand-held fire extinguishers must be the greater of—

\(1\) That provided in accordance with the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.851   Fire extinguishers.\|§25.851]], or

\(2\) A number equal to the number of originally type certificated exit pairs, regardless of whether the exits are deactivated for the proposed configuration.

\(b\) Extinguishers must be evenly distributed throughout the cabin. These extinguishers are in addition to those required by paragraph 14 of this SFAR, unless it can be shown that the cooktop was installed in the immediate vicinity of the original exits.

16\. *Security.* The requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.795   Security considerations.\|§25.795]] are not applicable to airplanes approved in accordance with this SFAR.

\(a\) The accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway is the greater of the following distances:

\(1\) The sum of the distances necessary to—

\(i\) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start with all engines operating to VEF for takeoff from a dry runway;

\(ii\) Allow the airplane to accelerate from VEF to the highest speed reached during the rejected takeoff, assuming the critical engine fails at VEF and the pilot takes the first action to reject the takeoff at the V1 for takeoff from a dry runway; and

\(iii\) Come to a full stop on a dry runway from the speed reached as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; plus

\(iv\) A distance equivalent to 2 seconds at the V1 for takeoff from a dry runway.

\(2\) The sum of the distances necessary to—

\(i\) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start with all engines operating to the highest speed reached during the rejected takeoff, assuming the pilot takes the first action to reject the takeoff at the V1 for takeoff from a dry runway; and

\(ii\) With all engines still operating, come to a full stop on dry runway from the speed reached as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; plus

\(iii\) A distance equivalent to 2 seconds at the V1 for takeoff from a dry runway.

\(b\) The accelerate-stop distance on a wet runway is the greater of the following distances:

\(1\) The accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or

\(2\) The accelerate-stop distance determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, except that the runway is wet and the corresponding wet runway values of VEF and V1 are used. In determining the wet runway accelerate-stop distance, the stopping force from the wheel brakes may never exceed:

\(i\) The wheel brakes stopping force determined in meeting the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.101   General.\|§25.101]](i) and paragraph (a) of this section; and

\(ii\) The force resulting from the wet runway braking coefficient of friction determined in accordance with paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable, taking into account the distribution of the normal load between braked and unbraked wheels at the most adverse center-of-gravity position approved for takeoff.

\(c\) The wet runway braking coefficient of friction for a smooth wet runway is defined as a curve of friction coefficient versus ground speed and must be computed as follows:

\(1\) The maximum tire-to-ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction is defined as:

\(2\) The maximum tire-to-ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction must be adjusted to take into account the efficiency of the anti-skid system on a wet runway. Anti-skid system operation must be demonstrated by flight testing on a smooth wet runway, and its efficiency must be determined. Unless a specific anti-skid system efficiency is determined from a quantitative analysis of the flight testing on a smooth wet runway, the maximum tire-to-ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be multiplied by the efficiency value associated with the type of anti-skid system installed on the airplane:

</div>

</div>

\(d\) At the option of the applicant, a higher wet runway braking coefficient of friction may be used for runway surfaces that have been grooved or treated with a porous friction course material.

\(1\) 70 percent of the dry runway braking coefficient of friction used to determine the dry runway accelerate-stop distance; or

\(2\) The wet runway braking coefficient defined in paragraph (c) of this section, except that a specific anti-skid system efficiency, if determined, is appropriate for a grooved or porous friction course wet runway, and the maximum tire-to-ground wet runway braking coefficient of friction is defined as:

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er18fe98.005.pdf)

\(e\) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, means other than wheel brakes may be used to determine the accelerate-stop distance if that means—

\(1\) Is safe and reliable;

\(2\) Is used so that consistent results can be expected under normal operating conditions; and

\(3\) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the airplane.

\(f\) The effects of available reverse thrust—

\(1\) Shall not be included as an additional means of deceleration when determining the accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway; and

\(2\) May be included as an additional means of deceleration using recommended reverse thrust procedures when determining the accelerate-stop distance on a wet runway, provided the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section are met.

\(g\) The landing gear must remain extended throughout the accelerate-stop distance.

\(h\) If the accelerate-stop distance includes a stopway with surface characteristics substantially different from those of the runway, the takeoff data must include operational correction factors for the accelerate-stop distance. The correction factors must account for the particular surface characteristics of the stopway and the variations in these characteristics with seasonal weather conditions (such as temperature, rain, snow, and ice) within the established operational limits.

\(i\) A flight test demonstration of the maximum brake kinetic energy accelerate-stop distance must be conducted with not more than 10 percent of the allowable brake wear range remaining on each of the airplane wheel brakes.

### §25.111   Takeoff path.

\(a\) The takeoff path extends from a standing start to a point in the takeoff at which the airplane is 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface, or at which the transition from the takeoff to the en route configuration is completed and VFTO is reached, whichever point is higher. In addition—

\(3\) After reaching *VEF,* the airplane must be accelerated to *V*2.

\(b\) During the acceleration to speed *V*2, the nose gear may be raised off the ground at a speed not less than *VR*. However, landing gear retraction may not be begun until the airplane is airborne.

\(3\) At each point along the takeoff path, starting at the point at which the airplane reaches 400 feet above the takeoff surface, the available gradient of climb may not be less than—

\(i\) 1.2 percent for two-engine airplanes;

\(ii\) 1.5 percent for three-engine airplanes; and

\(iii\) 1.7 percent for four-engine airplanes.

\(4\) The airplane configuration may not be changed, except for gear retraction and automatic propeller feathering, and no change in power or thrust that requires action by the pilot may be made until the airplane is 400 feet above the takeoff surface; and

\(5\) If [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.105   Takeoff.\|§25.105]](a)(2) requires the takeoff path to be determined for flight in icing conditions, the airborne part of the takeoff must be based on the airplane drag:

\(d\) The takeoff path must be determined by a continuous demonstrated takeoff or by synthesis from segments. If the takeoff path is determined by the segmental method—

\(1\) The segments must be clearly defined and must be related to the distinct changes in the configuration, power or thrust, and speed;

\(2\) The weight of the airplane, the configuration, and the power or thrust must be constant throughout each segment and must correspond to the most critical condition prevailing in the segment;

\(3\) The flight path must be based on the airplane's performance without ground effect; and

\(4\) The takeoff path data must be checked by continuous demonstrated takeoffs up to the point at which the airplane is out of ground effect and its speed is stabilized, to ensure that the path is conservative relative to the continous path.

\(e\) For airplanes equipped with standby power rocket engines, the takeoff path may be determined in accordance with section II of appendix E.

\(a\) It must be possible, at any point between the trim speed prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.103   Stall speed.\|§25.103]](b)(6) and stall identification (as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.201   Stall demonstration.\|§25.201]](d)), to pitch the nose downward so that the acceleration to this selected trim speed is prompt with

\(1\) The airplane trimmed at the trim speed prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.103   Stall speed.\|§25.103]](b)(6);

\(2\) The landing gear extended;

\(3\) The wing flaps (i) retracted and (ii) extended; and

\(4\) Power (i) off and (ii) at maximum continuous power on the engines.

\(b\) With the landing gear extended, no change in trim control, or exertion of more than 50 pounds control force (representative of the maximum short term force that can be applied readily by one hand) may be required for the following maneuvers:

\(1\) With power off, flaps retracted, and the airplane trimmed at 1.3 VSR1, extend the flaps as rapidly as possible while maintaining the airspeed at approximately 30 percent above the reference stall speed existing at each instant throughout the maneuver.

\(2\) Repeat paragraph (b)(1) except initially extend the flaps and then retract them as rapidly as possible.

\(3\) Repeat paragraph (b)(2), except at the go-around power or thrust setting.

\(4\) With power off, flaps retracted, and the airplane trimmed at 1.3 VSR1, rapidly set go-around power or thrust while maintaining the same airspeed.

\(5\) Repeat paragraph (b)(4) except with flaps extended.

\(e\) *Lateral control; airplanes with four or more engines.* Airplanes with four or more engines must be able to make 20° banked turns, with and against the inoperative engines, from steady flight at a speed equal to 1.3 *VS*R1, with maximum continuous power, and with the airplane in the configuration prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section.

\(f\) *Lateral control; all engines operating.* With the engines operating, roll response must allow normal maneuvers (such as recovery from upsets produced by gusts and the initiation of evasive maneuvers). There must be enough excess lateral control in sideslips (up to sideslip angles that might be required in normal operation), to allow a limited amount of maneuvering and to correct for gusts. Lateral control must be enough at any speed up to *VFC*/*MFC* to provide a peak roll rate necessary for safety, without excessive control forces or travel.

### §25.149   Minimum control speed.

\(a\) In establishing the minimum control speeds required by this section, the method used to simulate critical engine failure must represent the most critical mode of powerplant failure with respect to controllability expected in service.

\(b\) V*MC* is the calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane with that engine still inoperative and maintain straight flight with an angle of bank of not more than 5 degrees.

\(c\) *VMC* may not exceed 1.13 *VSR* with—

\(1\) Maximum available takeoff power or thrust on the engines;

\(2\) The most unfavorable center of gravity;

\(3\) The airplane trimmed for takeoff;

\(4\) The maximum sea level takeoff weight (or any lesser weight necessary to show *VMC*);

\(5\) The airplane in the most critical takeoff configuration existing along the flight path after the airplane becomes airborne, except with the landing gear retracted;

\(6\) The airplane airborne and the ground effect negligible; and

\(7\) If applicable, the propeller of the inoperative engine—

\(i\) Windmilling;

\(ii\) In the most probable position for the specific design of the propeller control; or

\(iii\) Feathered, if the airplane has an automatic feathering device acceptable for showing compliance with the climb requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.121   Climb: One-engine-inoperative.\|§25.121]].

\(d\) The rudder forces required to maintain control at *VMC* may not exceed 150 pounds nor may it be necessary to reduce power or thrust of the operative engines. During recovery, the airplane may not assume any dangerous attitude or require exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength to prevent a heading change of more than 20 degrees.

\(e\) VMCG, the minimum control speed on the ground, is the calibrated airspeed during the takeoff run at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane using the rudder control alone (without the use of nosewheel steering), as limited by 150 pounds of force, and the lateral control to the extent of keeping the wings level to enable the takeoff to be safely continued using normal piloting skill. In the determination of V*MCG*, assuming that the path of the airplane accelerating with all engines operating is along the centerline of the runway, its path from the point at which the critical engine is made inoperative to the point at which recovery to a direction parallel to the centerline is completed may not deviate more than 30 feet laterally from the centerline at any point. VMCG must be established with—

\(1\) The airplane in each takeoff configuration or, at the option of the applicant, in the most critical takeoff configuration;

\(2\) Maximum available takeoff power or thrust on the operating engines;

\(3\) The most unfavorable center of gravity;

\(4\) The airplane trimmed for takeoff; and

\(5\) The most unfavorable weight in the range of takeoff weights.

\(f\) V*MCL*, the minimum control speed during approach and landing with all engines operating, is the calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane with that engine still inoperative, and maintain straight flight with an angle of bank of not more than 5 degrees. V*MCL* must be established with—

\(1\) The airplane in the most critical configuration (or, at the option of the applicant, each configuration) for approach and landing with all engines operating;

\(2\) The most unfavorable center of gravity;

\(3\) The airplane trimmed for approach with all engines operating;

\(4\) The most favorable weight, or, at the option of the applicant, as a function of weight;

\(5\) For propeller airplanes, the propeller of the inoperative engine in the position it achieves without pilot action, assuming the engine fails while at the power or thrust necessary to maintain a three degree approach path angle; and

\(6\) Go-around power or thrust setting on the operating engine(s).

### §25.177   Static lateral-directional stability.

\(a\) The static directional stability (as shown by the tendency to recover from a skid with the rudder free) must be positive for any landing gear and flap position and symmetric power condition, at speeds from 1.13 VSR1, up to VFE, VLE, or VFC/MFC (as appropriate for the airplane configuration).

\(b\) The static lateral stability (as shown by the tendency to raise the low wing in a sideslip with the aileron controls free) for any landing gear and flap position and symmetric power condition, may not be negative at any airspeed (except that speeds higher than VFE need not be considered for flaps extended configurations nor speeds higher than VLE for landing gear extended configurations) in the following airspeed ranges:

\(1\) From 1.13 VSR1 to VMO/MMO.

\(2\) From VMO/MMO to VFC/MFC, unless the divergence is—

\(i\) Gradual;

\(ii\) Easily recognizable by the pilot; and

\(iii\) Easily controllable by the pilot.

\(c\) The following requirement must be met for the configurations and speed specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In straight, steady sideslips over the range of sideslip angles appropriate to the operation of the airplane, the aileron and rudder control movements and forces must be substantially proportional to the angle of sideslip in a stable sense. This factor of proportionality must lie between limits found necessary for safe operation. The range of sideslip angles evaluated must include those sideslip angles resulting from the lesser of:

\(d\) For sideslip angles greater than those prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section, up to the angle at which full rudder control is used or a rudder control force of 180 pounds is obtained, the rudder control forces may not reverse, and increased rudder deflection must be needed for increased angles of sideslip. Compliance with this requirement must be shown using straight, steady sideslips, unless full lateral control input is achieved before reaching either full rudder control input or a rudder control force of 180 pounds; a straight, steady sideslip need not be maintained after achieving full lateral control input. This requirement must be met at all approved landing gear and flap positions for the range of operating speeds and power conditions appropriate to each landing gear and flap position with all engines operating.

### Stalls

### §25.201   Stall demonstration.

\(a\) Stalls must be shown in straight flight and in 30 degree banked turns with—

\(1\) Power off; and

\(2\) The power necessary to maintain level flight at 1.5 V*SR1* (where V*SR1* corresponds to the reference stall speed at maximum landing weight with flaps in the approach position and the landing gear retracted).

\(b\) In each condition required by paragraph (a) of this section, it must be possible to meet the applicable requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.203   Stall characteristics.\|§25.203]] with—

\(1\) Flaps, landing gear, and deceleration devices in any likely combination of positions approved for operation;

\(2\) Representative weights within the range for which certification is requested;

\(3\) The most adverse center of gravity for recovery; and

\(4\) The airplane trimmed for straight flight at the speed prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.103   Stall speed.\|§25.103]](b)(6).

\(c\) The following procedures must be used to show compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.203   Stall characteristics.\|§25.203]];

\(1\) Starting at a speed sufficiently above the stalling speed to ensure that a steady rate of speed reduction can be established, apply the longitudinal control so that the speed reduction does not exceed one knot per second until the airplane is stalled.

\(2\) In addition, for turning flight stalls, apply the longitudinal control to achieve airspeed deceleration rates up to 3 knots per second.

\(3\) As soon as the airplane is stalled, recover by normal recovery techniques.

\(d\) The airplane is considered stalled when the behavior of the airplane gives the pilot a clear and distinctive indication of an acceptable nature that the airplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination, are—

\(1\) A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested;

\(2\) Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective deterrent to further speed reduction; or

\(3\) The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before recovery is initiated.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-84, 60 FR 30750, June 9, 1995; Amdt. 25-108, 67 FR 70827, Nov. 26, 2002\]

### §25.203   Stall characteristics.

\(a\) It must be possible to produce and to correct roll and yaw by unreversed use of the aileron and rudder controls, up to the time the airplane is stalled. No abnormal nose-up pitching may occur. The longitudinal control force must be positive up to and throughout the stall. In addition, it must be possible to promptly prevent stalling and to recover from a stall by normal use of the controls.

\(b\) For level wing stalls, the roll occurring between the stall and the completion of the recovery may not exceed approximately 20 degrees.

\(c\) For turning flight stalls, the action of the airplane after the stall may not be so violent or extreme as to make it difficult, with normal piloting skill, to effect a prompt recovery and to regain control of the airplane. The maximum bank angle that occurs during the recovery may not exceed—

\(1\) Approximately 60 degrees in the original direction of the turn, or 30 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates up to 1 knot per second; and

\(2\) Approximately 90 degrees in the original direction of the turn, or 60 degrees in the opposite direction, for deceleration rates in excess of 1 knot per second.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-84, 60 FR 30750, June 9, 1995\]

### §25.207   Stall warning.

\(a\) Stall warning with sufficient margin to prevent inadvertent stalling with the flaps and landing gear in any normal position must be clear and distinctive to the pilot in straight and turning flight.

\(b\) The warning must be furnished either through the inherent aerodynamic qualities of the airplane or by a device that will give clearly distinguishable indications under expected conditions of flight. However, a visual stall warning device that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself. If a warning device is used, it must provide a warning in each of the airplane configurations prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section at the speed prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Except for the stall warning prescribed in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, the stall warning for flight in icing conditions must be provided by the same means as the stall warning for flight in non-icing conditions.

\(c\) When the speed is reduced at rates not exceeding one knot per second, stall warning must begin, in each normal configuration, at a speed, VSW, exceeding the speed at which the stall is identified in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.201   Stall demonstration.\|§25.201]](d) by not less than five knots or five percent CAS, whichever is greater. Once initiated, stall warning must continue until the angle of attack is reduced to approximately that at which stall warning began.

\(d\) In addition to the requirement of paragraph (c) of this section, when the speed is reduced at rates not exceeding one knot per second, in straight flight with engines idling and at the center-of-gravity position specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.103   Stall speed.\|§25.103]](b)(5), VSW, in each normal configuration, must exceed VSR by not less than three knots or three percent CAS, whichever is greater.

\(e\) In icing conditions, the stall warning margin in straight and turning flight must be sufficient to allow the pilot to prevent stalling (as defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.201   Stall demonstration.\|§25.201]](d)) when the pilot starts a recovery maneuver not less than three seconds after the onset of stall warning. When demonstrating compliance with this paragraph, the pilot must perform the recovery maneuver in the same way as for the airplane in non-icing conditions. Compliance with this requirement must be demonstrated in flight with the speed reduced at rates not exceeding one knot per second, with—

\(1\) The most critical of the takeoff ice and final takeoff ice accretions defined in Appendices C and O of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), for each configuration used in the takeoff phase of flight;

\(2\) The most critical of the en route ice accretion(s) defined in Appendices C and O of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), for the en route configuration;

\(3\) The most critical of the holding ice accretion(s) defined in Appendices C and O of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), for the holding configuration(s);

\(4\) The most critical of the approach ice accretion(s) defined in Appendices C and O of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), for the approach configuration(s); and

\(5\) The most critical of the landing ice accretion(s) defined in Appendices C and O of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), for the landing and go-around configuration(s).

\(f\) The stall warning margin must be sufficient in both non-icing and icing conditions to allow the pilot to prevent stalling when the pilot starts a recovery maneuver not less than one second after the onset of stall warning in slow-down turns with at least 1.5 g load factor normal to the flight path and airspeed deceleration rates of at least 2 knots per second. When demonstrating compliance with this paragraph for icing conditions, the pilot must perform the recovery maneuver in the same way as for the airplane in non-icing conditions. Compliance with this requirement must be demonstrated in flight with—

\(1\) The flaps and landing gear in any normal position;

\(2\) The airplane trimmed for straight flight at a speed of 1.3 VSR; and

\(3\) The power or thrust necessary to maintain level flight at 1.3 VSR.

\(g\) Stall warning must also be provided in each abnormal configuration of the high lift devices that is likely to be used in flight following system failures (including all configurations covered by Airplane Flight Manual procedures).

\(h\) The following stall warning margin is required for flight in icing conditions before the ice protection system has been activated and is performing its intended function. Compliance must be shown using the most critical of the ice accretion(s) defined in Appendix C, part II, paragraph (e) of this part and Appendix O, part II, paragraph (d) of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g). The stall warning margin in straight and turning flight must be sufficient to allow the pilot to prevent stalling without encountering any adverse flight characteristics when:

\(1\) The speed is reduced at rates not exceeding one knot per second;

\(2\) The pilot performs the recovery maneuver in the same way as for flight in non-icing conditions; and

\(3\) The recovery maneuver is started no earlier than:

\(i\) One second after the onset of stall warning if stall warning is provided by the same means as for flight in non-icing conditions; or

\(ii\) Three seconds after the onset of stall warning if stall warning is provided by a different means than for flight in non-icing conditions.

\(i\) In showing compliance with paragraph (h) of this section, if stall warning is provided by a different means in icing conditions than for non-icing conditions, compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.203   Stall characteristics.\|§25.203]] must be shown using the accretion defined in appendix C, part II(e) of this part. Compliance with this requirement must be shown using the demonstration prescribed by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.201   Stall demonstration.\|§25.201]], except that the deceleration rates of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.201   Stall demonstration.\|§25.201]](c)(2) need not be demonstrated.

### Ground and Water Handling Characteristics

### §25.231   Longitudinal stability and control.

\(2\) If a tail-wheel landing gear is used, it must be possible, during the takeoff ground run on concrete, to maintain any attitude up to thrust line level, at 75 percent of *VSR*1.

\(b\) For seaplanes and amphibians, the most adverse water conditions safe for takeoff, taxiing, and landing, must be established.

### §25.233   Directional stability and control.

\(a\) There may be no uncontrollable ground-looping tendency in 90° cross winds, up to a wind velocity of 20 knots or 0.2 *VSR*0, whichever is greater, except that the wind velocity need not exceed 25 knots at any speed at which the airplane may be expected to be operated on the ground. This may be shown while establishing the 90° cross component of wind velocity required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.237   Wind velocities.\|§25.237]].

\(b\) Landplanes must be satisfactorily controllable, without exceptional piloting skill or alertness, in power-off landings at normal landing speed, without using brakes or engine power to maintain a straight path. This may be shown during power-off landings made in conjunction with other tests.

\(a\) For land planes and amphibians, the following applies:

\(1\) A 90-degree cross component of wind velocity, demonstrated to be safe for takeoff and landing, must be established for dry runways and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2 VSR0, whichever is greater, except that it need not exceed 25 knots.

\(2\) The crosswind component for takeoff established without ice accretions is valid in icing conditions.

\(3\) The landing crosswind component must be established for:

\(i\) Non-icing conditions, and

\(ii\) Icing conditions with the most critical of the landing ice accretion(s) defined in Appendices C and O of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g).

\(b\) For seaplanes and amphibians, the following applies:

\(1\) A 90-degree cross component of wind velocity, up to which takeoff and landing is safe under all water conditions that may reasonably be expected in normal operation, must be established and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2 V*SR*0, whichever is greater, except that it need not exceed 25 knots.

\(2\) A wind velocity, for which taxiing is safe in any direction under all water conditions that may reasonably be expected in normal operation, must be established and must be at least 20 knots or 0.2 V*SR0*, whichever is greater, except that it need not exceed 25 knots.

### §25.239   Spray characteristics, control, and stability on water.

\(a\) For seaplanes and amphibians, during takeoff, taxiing, and landing, and in the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, there may be no—

\(1\) Spray characteristics that would impair the pilot's view, cause damage, or result in the taking in of an undue quantity of water;

\(2\) Dangerously uncontrollable porpoising, bounding, or swinging tendency; or

\(3\) Immersion of auxiliary floats or sponsons, wing tips, propeller blades, or other parts not designed to withstand the resulting water loads.

\(b\) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must be shown—

\(1\) In water conditions, from smooth to the most adverse condition established in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.231   Longitudinal stability and control.\|§25.231]];

\(2\) In wind and cross-wind velocities, water currents, and associated waves and swells that may reasonably be expected in operation on water;

\(3\) At speeds that may reasonably be expected in operation on water;

\(4\) With sudden failure of the critical engine at any time while on water; and

\(5\) At each weight and center of gravity position, relevant to each operating condition, within the range of loading conditions for which certification is requested.

\(c\) In the water conditions of paragraph (b) of this section, and in the corresponding wind conditions, the seaplane or amphibian must be able to drift for five minutes with engines inoperative, aided, if necessary, by a sea anchor.

### Miscellaneous Flight Requirements

### §25.251   Vibration and buffeting.

\(a\) The airplane must be demonstrated in flight to be free from any vibration and buffeting that would prevent continued safe flight in any likely operating condition.

\(b\) Each part of the airplane must be demonstrated in flight to be free from excessive vibration under any appropriate speed and power conditions up to VDF/MDF. The maximum speeds shown must be used in establishing the operating limitations of the airplane in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1505   Maximum operating limit speed.\|§25.1505]].

\(c\) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, there may be no buffeting condition, in normal flight, including configuration changes during cruise, severe enough to interfere with the control of the airplane, to cause excessive fatigue to the crew, or to cause structural damage. Stall warning buffeting within these limits is allowable.

\(d\) There may be no perceptible buffeting condition in the cruise configuration in straight flight at any speed up to *VMO*/*MMO,* except that stall warning buffeting is allowable.

\(e\) For an airplane with MD greater than .6 or with a maximum operating altitude greater than 25,000 feet, the positive maneuvering load factors at which the onset of perceptible buffeting occurs must be determined with the airplane in the cruise configuration for the ranges of airspeed or Mach number, weight, and altitude for which the airplane is to be certificated. The envelopes of load factor, speed, altitude, and weight must provide a sufficient range of speeds and load factors for normal operations. Probable inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes may not result in unsafe conditions.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5671, Apr. 8, 1970; Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29775, July 20, 1990; Amdt. 25-77, 57 FR 28949, June 29, 1992\]

### §25.253   High-speed characteristics.

\(a\) *Speed increase and recovery characteristics.* The following speed increase and recovery characteristics must be met:

\(1\) Operating conditions and characteristics likely to cause inadvertent speed increases (including upsets in pitch and roll) must be simulated with the airplane trimmed at any likely cruise speed up to *VMO*/*MMO*. These conditions and characteristics include gust upsets, inadvertent control movements, low stick force gradient in relation to control friction, passenger movement, leveling off from climb, and descent from Mach to airspeed limit altitudes.

\(2\) Allowing for pilot reaction time after effective inherent or artificial speed warning occurs, it must be shown that the airplane can be recovered to a normal attitude and its speed reduced to *VMO*/*MMO,* without—

\(i\) Exceptional piloting strength or skill;

\(ii\) Exceeding *VD*/*MD,* *VDF*/*MDF,* or the structural limitations; and

\(iii\) Buffeting that would impair the pilot's ability to read the instruments or control the airplane for recovery.

\(3\) With the airplane trimmed at any speed up to VMO/MMO, there must be no reversal of the response to control input about any axis at any speed up to VDF/MDF. Any tendency to pitch, roll, or yaw must be mild and readily controllable, using normal piloting techniques. When the airplane is trimmed at VMO/MMO, the slope of the elevator control force versus speed curve need not be stable at speeds greater than VFC/MFC, but there must be a push force at all speeds up to VDF/MDF and there must be no sudden or excessive reduction of elevator control force as VDF/MDF is reached.

\(4\) Adequate roll capability to assure a prompt recovery from a lateral upset condition must be available at any speed up to VDF/MDF.

\(5\) With the airplane trimmed at VMO/MMO, extension of the speedbrakes over the available range of movements of the pilot's control, at all speeds above VMO/MMO, but not so high that VDF/MDF would be exceeded during the maneuver, must not result in:

\(i\) An excessive positive load factor when the pilot does not take action to counteract the effects of extension;

\(ii\) Buffeting that would impair the pilot's ability to read the instruments or control the airplane for recovery; or

\(iii\) A nose down pitching moment, unless it is small.

\(b\) *Maximum speed for stability characteristics, VFC/MFC*. VFC/MFC is the maximum speed at which the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.143   General.\|§§25.143]](g), 25.147(f), 25.175(b)(1), 25.177(a) through (c), and 25.181 must be met with flaps and landing gear retracted. Except as noted in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.253   High-speed characteristics.\|§25.253]](c), VFC/MFC may not be less than a speed midway between VMO/MMO and VDF/MDF, except that, for altitudes where Mach number is the limiting factor, MFC need not exceed the Mach number at which effective speed warning occurs.

\(c\) *Maximum speed for stability characteristics in icing conditions.* The maximum speed for stability characteristics with the most critical of the ice accretions defined in Appendices C and O of this part, as applicable, in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), at which the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.143   General.\|§§25.143]](g), 25.147(f), 25.175(b)(1), 25.177(a) through (c), and 25.181 must be met, is the lower of:

\(1\) 300 knots CAS;

\(2\) VFC; or

\(3\) A speed at which it is demonstrated that the airframe will be free of ice accretion due to the effects of increased dynamic pressure.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5671, Apr. 8, 1970; Amdt. 25-54, 45 FR 60172, Sept. 11, 1980; Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29775, July 20, 1990; Amdt. 25-84, 60 FR 30750, June 9, 1995; Amdt. 25-121, 72 FR 44668, Aug. 8, 2007; Amdt. 25-135, 76 FR 74654, Dec. 1, 2011; Amdt. 25-140,79 FR 65525, Nov. 4, 2014\]

### §25.255   Out-of-trim characteristics.

\(a\) From an initial condition with the airplane trimmed at cruise speeds up to V*MO*/M*MO,* the airplane must have satisfactory maneuvering stability and controllability with the degree of out-of-trim in both the airplane nose-up and nose-down directions, which results from the greater of—

\(1\) A three-second movement of the longitudinal trim system at its normal rate for the particular flight condition with no aerodynamic load (or an equivalent degree of trim for airplanes that do not have a power-operated trim system), except as limited by stops in the trim system, including those required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.655   Installation.\|§25.655]](b) for adjustable stabilizers; or

\(2\) The maximum mistrim that can be sustained by the autopilot while maintaining level flight in the high speed cruising condition.

\(b\) In the out-of-trim condition specified in paragraph (a) of this section, when the normal acceleration is varied from + 1 g to the positive and negative values specified in paragraph (c) of this section—

\(1\) The stick force vs. g curve must have a positive slope at any speed up to and including VFC/MFC; and

\(2\) At speeds between VFC/MFC and VDF/MDF the direction of the primary longitudinal control force may not reverse.

\(c\) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section must be demonstrated in flight over the acceleration range—

\(1\) −1 g to + 2.5 g; or

\(2\) 0 g to 2.0 g, and extrapolating by an acceptable method to −1 g and + 2.5 g.

\(d\) If the procedure set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is used to demonstrate compliance and marginal conditions exist during flight test with regard to reversal of primary longitudinal control force, flight tests must be accomplished from the normal acceleration at which a marginal condition is found to exist to the applicable limit specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

\(e\) During flight tests required by paragraph (a) of this section, the limit maneuvering load factors prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.333   Flight maneuvering envelope.\|§§25.333]](b) and 25.337, and the maneuvering load factors associated with probable inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes determined under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.251   Vibration and buffeting.\|§25.251]](e), need not be exceeded. In addition, the entry speeds for flight test demonstrations at normal acceleration values less than 1 g must be limited to the extent necessary to accomplish a recovery without exceeding VDF/MDF.

\(f\) In the out-of-trim condition specified in paragraph (a) of this section, it must be possible from an overspeed condition at VDF/MDF to produce at least 1.5 g for recovery by applying not more than 125 pounds of longitudinal control force using either the primary longitudinal control alone or the primary longitudinal control and the longitudinal trim system. If the longitudinal trim is used to assist in producing the required load factor, it must be shown at VDF/MDF that the longitudinal trim can be actuated in the airplane nose-up direction with the primary surface loaded to correspond to the least of the following airplane nose-up control forces:

\(1\) The maximum control forces expected in service as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.301   Loads.\|§§25.301]] and 25.397.

\(2\) The control force required to produce 1.5 g.

\(3\) The control force corresponding to buffeting or other phenomena of such intensity that it is a strong deterrent to further application of primary longitudinal control force.

\[Amdt. 25-42, 43 FR 2322, Jan. 16, 1978\]

## Subpart C—Structure

### General

### §25.301   Loads.

\(a\) Strength requirements are specified in terms of limit loads (the maximum loads to be expected in service) and ultimate loads (limit loads multiplied by prescribed factors of safety). Unless otherwise provided, prescribed loads are limit loads.

\(b\) Unless otherwise provided, the specified air, ground, and water loads must be placed in equilibrium with inertia forces, considering each item of mass in the airplane. These loads must be distributed to conservatively approximate or closely represent actual conditions. Methods used to determine load intensities and distribution must be validated by flight load measurement unless the methods used for determining those loading conditions are shown to be reliable.

\(c\) If deflections under load would significantly change the distribution of external or internal loads, this redistribution must be taken into account.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5672, Apr. 8, 1970\]

### §25.303   Factor of safety.

Unless otherwise specified, a factor of safety of 1.5 must be applied to the prescribed limit load which are considered external loads on the structure. When a loading condition is prescribed in terms of ultimate loads, a factor of safety need not be applied unless otherwise specified.

\[Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5672, Apr. 8, 1970\]

### §25.305   Strength and deformation.

\(a\) The structure must be able to support limit loads without detrimental permanent deformation. At any load up to limit loads, the deformation may not interfere with safe operation.

\(b\) The structure must be able to support ultimate loads without failure for at least 3 seconds. However, when proof of strength is shown by dynamic tests simulating actual load conditions, the 3-second limit does not apply. Static tests conducted to ultimate load must include the ultimate deflections and ultimate deformation induced by the loading. When analytical methods are used to show compliance with the ultimate load strength requirements, it must be shown that—

\(1\) The effects of deformation are not significant;

\(2\) The deformations involved are fully accounted for in the analysis; or

\(3\) The methods and assumptions used are sufficient to cover the effects of these deformations.

\(c\) Where structural flexibility is such that any rate of load application likely to occur in the operating conditions might produce transient stresses appreciably higher than those corresponding to static loads, the effects of this rate of application must be considered.

\(d\) \[Reserved\]

\(e\) The airplane must be designed to withstand any vibration and buffeting that might occur in any likely operating condition up to VD/MD, including stall and probable inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelope. This must be shown by analysis, flight tests, or other tests found necessary by the Administrator.

\(f\) Unless shown to be extremely improbable, the airplane must be designed to withstand any forced structural vibration resulting from any failure, malfunction or adverse condition in the flight control system. These must be considered limit loads and must be investigated at airspeeds up to VC/MC.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5672, Apr. 8, 1970; Amdt. 25-54, 45 FR 60172, Sept. 11, 1980; Amdt. 25-77, 57 FR 28949, June 29, 1992; Amdt. 25-86, 61 FR 5220, Feb. 9, 1996\]

### §25.307   Proof of structure.

\(a\) Compliance with the strength and deformation requirements of this subpart must be shown for each critical loading condition. Structural analysis may be used only if the structure conforms to that for which experience has shown this method to be reliable. In other cases, substantiating tests must be made to load levels that are sufficient to verify structural behavior up to loads specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.305   Strength and deformation.\|§25.305]].

(b)-(c) \[Reserved\]

\(d\) When static or dynamic tests are used to show compliance with the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.305   Strength and deformation.\|§25.305]](b) for flight structures, appropriate material correction factors must be applied to the test results, unless the structure, or part thereof, being tested has features such that a number of elements contribute to the total strength of the structure and the failure of one element results in the redistribution of the load through alternate load paths.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5672, Apr. 8, 1970; Amdt. 25-54, 45 FR 60172, Sept. 11, 1980; Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29775, July 20, 1990; 79 FR 59429, Oct. 2, 2014\]

### Flight Loads

### §25.321   General.

\(a\) Flight load factors represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the airplane) to the weight of the airplane. A positive load factor is one in which the aerodynamic force acts upward with respect to the airplane.

\(b\) Considering compressibility effects at each speed, compliance with the flight load requirements of this subpart must be shown—

\(1\) At each critical altitude within the range of altitudes selected by the applicant;

\(2\) At each weight from the design minimum weight to the design maximum weight appropriate to each particular flight load condition; and

\(3\) For each required altitude and weight, for any practicable distribution of disposable load within the operating limitations recorded in the Airplane Flight Manual.

\(c\) Enough points on and within the boundaries of the design envelope must be investigated to ensure that the maximum load for each part of the airplane structure is obtained.

\(d\) The significant forces acting on the airplane must be placed in equilibrium in a rational or conservative manner. The linear inertia forces must be considered in equilibrium with the thrust and all aerodynamic loads, while the angular (pitching) inertia forces must be considered in equilibrium with thrust and all aerodynamic moments, including moments due to loads on components such as tail surfaces and nacelles. Critical thrust values in the range from zero to maximum continuous thrust must be considered.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5672, Apr. 8, 1970; Amdt. 25-86, 61 FR 5220, Feb. 9, 1996\]

### Flight Maneuver and Gust Conditions

### §25.331   Symmetric maneuvering conditions.

\(a\) *Procedure.* For the analysis of the maneuvering flight conditions specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the following provisions apply:

\(1\) Where sudden displacement of a control is specified, the assumed rate of control surface displacement may not be less than the rate that could be applied by the pilot through the control system.

\(2\) In determining elevator angles and chordwise load distribution in the maneuvering conditions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the effect of corresponding pitching velocities must be taken into account. The in-trim and out-of-trim flight conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.255   Out-of-trim characteristics.\|§25.255]] must be considered.

\(b\) *Maneuvering balanced conditions.* Assuming the airplane to be in equilibrium with zero pitching acceleration, the maneuvering conditions A through I on the maneuvering envelope in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.333   Flight maneuvering envelope.\|§25.333]](b) must be investigated.

\(c\) *Maneuvering pitching conditions.* The following conditions must be investigated:

\(1\) *Maximum pitch control displacement at V*A. The airplane is assumed to be flying in steady level flight (point A1, [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.333   Flight maneuvering envelope.\|§25.333]](b)) and the cockpit pitch control is suddenly moved to obtain extreme nose up pitching acceleration. In defining the tail load, the response of the airplane must be taken into account. Airplane loads that occur subsequent to the time when normal acceleration at the c.g. exceeds the positive limit maneuvering load factor (at point A2 in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.333   Flight maneuvering envelope.\|§25.333]](b)), or the resulting tailplane normal load reaches its maximum, whichever occurs first, need not be considered.

\(2\) *Checked maneuver between VA* and *VD*. Nose-up checked pitching maneuvers must be analyzed in which the positive limit load factor prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.337   Limit maneuvering load factors.\|§25.337]] is achieved. As a separate condition, nose-down checked pitching maneuvers must be analyzed in which a limit load factor of 0g is achieved. In defining the airplane loads, the flight deck pitch control motions described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section must be used:

\(i\) The airplane is assumed to be flying in steady level flight at any speed between VA and VD and the flight deck pitch control is moved in accordance with the following formula:

δ(t) = δ1 sin(ωt) for 0 ≤ t ≤ tmax

\(ii\) For nose-up pitching maneuvers, the complete flight deck pitch control displacement history may be scaled down in amplitude to the extent necessary to ensure that the positive limit load factor prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.337   Limit maneuvering load factors.\|§25.337]] is not exceeded. For nose-down pitching maneuvers, the complete flight deck control displacement history may be scaled down in amplitude to the extent necessary to ensure that the normal acceleration at the center of gravity does not go below 0g.

\(iii\) In addition, for cases where the airplane response to the specified flight deck pitch control motion does not achieve the prescribed limit load factors, then the following flight deck pitch control motion must be used:

δ(t) = δ1 sin(ωt) for 0 ≤ t ≤ t1

δ(t) = δ1 for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2

δ(t) = δ1 sin(ω\[t + t1 − t2\]) for t2 ≤ t ≤ tmax

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er11de14.024.pdf)

\(iv\) In cases where the flight deck pitch control motion may be affected by inputs from systems (for example, by a stick pusher that can operate at high load factor as well as at 1g), then the effects of those systems shall be taken into account.

\(v\) Airplane loads that occur beyond the following times need not be considered:

\(A\) For the nose-up pitching maneuver, the time at which the normal acceleration at the center of gravity goes below 0g;

\(B\) For the nose-down pitching maneuver, the time at which the normal acceleration at the center of gravity goes above the positive limit load factor prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.337   Limit maneuvering load factors.\|§25.337]];

### §25.333   Flight maneuvering envelope.

\(a\) *General.* The strength requirements must be met at each combination of airspeed and load factor on and within the boundaries of the representative maneuvering envelope (*V-n* diagram) of paragraph (b) of this section. This envelope must also be used in determining the airplane structural operating limitations as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1501   General.\|§25.1501]].

### §25.335   Design airspeeds.

The selected design airspeeds are equivalent airspeeds (EAS). Estimated values of *VS*0 and *VS*1 must be conservative.

\(a\) *Design cruising speed, VC*. For *VC,* the following apply:

\(1\) The minimum value of *VC* must be sufficiently greater than *VB* to provide for inadvertent speed increases likely to occur as a result of severe atmospheric turbulence.

\(2\) Except as provided in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.335   Design airspeeds.\|§25.335]](d)(2), VC may not be less than VB + 1.32 UREF (with UREF as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a)(5)(i)). However VC need not exceed the maximum speed in level flight at maximum continuous power for the corresponding altitude.

\(3\) At altitudes where *VD* is limited by Mach number, *VC* may be limited to a selected Mach number.

\(b\) *Design dive speed, VD*. *VD* must be selected so that *VC*/*MC* is not greater than 0.8 *VD*/*MD,* or so that the minimum speed margin between *VC*/*MC* and *VD*/*MD* is the greater of the following values:

\(1\) From an initial condition of stabilized flight at *VC*/*MC,* the airplane is upset, flown for 20 seconds along a flight path 7.5° below the initial path, and then pulled up at a load factor of 1.5*g* (0.5*g* acceleration increment). The speed increase occurring in this maneuver may be calculated if reliable or conservative aerodynamic data is used. Power as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.175   Demonstration of static longitudinal stability.\|§25.175]](b)(1)(iv) is assumed until the pullup is initiated, at which time power reduction and the use of pilot controlled drag devices may be assumed;

\(2\) The minimum speed margin must be enough to provide for atmospheric variations (such as horizontal gusts, and penetration of jet streams and cold fronts) and for instrument errors and airframe production variations. These factors may be considered on a probability basis. The margin at altitude where MC is limited by compressibility effects must not less than 0.07M unless a lower margin is determined using a rational analysis that includes the effects of any automatic systems. In any case, the margin may not be reduced to less than 0.05M.

\(c\) *Design maneuvering speed VA*. For *VA*, the following apply:

\(1\) V*A* may not be less than V*S*1 √n where—

\(i\) *n* is the limit positive maneuvering load factor at *VC*; and

\(ii\) *VS*1 is the stalling speed with flaps retracted.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er09fe96.019.pdf)

\(5\) The following reference gust velocities apply:

\(i\) At airplane speeds between VB and VC: Positive and negative gusts with reference gust velocities of 56.0 ft/sec EAS must be considered at sea level. The reference gust velocity may be reduced linearly from 56.0 ft/sec EAS at sea level to 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15,000 feet. The reference gust velocity may be further reduced linearly from 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15,000 feet to 20.86 ft/sec EAS at 60,000 feet.

\(ii\) At the airplane design speed VD: The reference gust velocity must be 0.5 times the value obtained under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a)(5)(i).

\(6\) The flight profile alleviation factor, Fg, must be increased linearly from the sea level value to a value of 1.0 at the maximum operating altitude defined in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1527   Ambient air temperature and operating altitude.\|§25.1527]]. At sea level, the flight profile alleviation factor is determined by the following equation:

</div>

\(7\) When a stability augmentation system is included in the analysis, the effect of any significant system nonlinearities should be accounted for when deriving limit loads from limit gust conditions.

\(b\) *Continuous turbulence design criteria.* The dynamic response of the airplane to vertical and lateral continuous turbulence must be taken into account. The dynamic analysis must take into account unsteady aerodynamic characteristics and all significant structural degrees of freedom including rigid body motions. The limit loads must be determined for all critical altitudes, weights, and weight distributions as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.321   General.\|§25.321]](b), and all critical speeds within the ranges indicated in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](b)(3).

\(1\) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, the following equation must be used:

*P*L = PL−1*g* ± UσA̅

\(2\) Values of A must be determined according to the following formula:

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er11de14.026.pdf)

\(3\) The limit turbulence intensities, Uσ, in feet per second true airspeed required for compliance with this paragraph are—

\(i\) At airplane speeds between VB and VC:

Uσ = Uσref Fg

\(ii\) At speed VD: Uσ is equal to 1⁄2 the values obtained under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

\(iii\) At speeds between VC and VD: Uσ is equal to a value obtained by linear interpolation.

\(iv\) At all speeds, both positive and negative incremental loads due to continuous turbulence must be considered.

\(4\) When an automatic system affecting the dynamic response of the airplane is included in the analysis, the effects of system non-linearities on loads at the limit load level must be taken into account in a realistic or conservative manner.

\(5\) If necessary for the assessment of loads on airplanes with significant non-linearities, it must be assumed that the turbulence field has a root-mean-square velocity equal to 40 percent of the Uσ values specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The value of limit load is that load with the same probability of exceedance in the turbulence field as AUσ of the same load quantity in a linear approximated model.

\(c\) *Supplementary gust conditions for wing-mounted engines.* For airplanes equipped with wing-mounted engines, the engine mounts, pylons, and wing supporting structure must be designed for the maximum response at the nacelle center of gravity derived from the following dynamic gust conditions applied to the airplane:

\(1\) A discrete gust determined in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a) at each angle normal to the flight path, and separately,

\(2\) A pair of discrete gusts, one vertical and one lateral. The length of each of these gusts must be independently tuned to the maximum response in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a). The penetration of the airplane in the combined gust field and the phasing of the vertical and lateral component gusts must be established to develop the maximum response to the gust pair. In the absence of a more rational analysis, the following formula must be used for each of the maximum engine loads in all six degrees of freedom:

The resulting limit loads must correspond to the conditions determined as follows:

\(1\) Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor of 2.0; and

\(2\) Positive and negative gusts of 25 ft/sec EAS acting normal to the flight path in level flight. Gust loads resulting on each part of the structure must be determined by rational analysis.

### §25.349   Rolling conditions.

The airplane must be designed for loads resulting from the rolling conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Unbalanced aerodynamic moments about the center of gravity must be reacted in a rational or conservative manner, considering the principal masses furnishing the reacting inertia forces.

\(a\) *Maneuvering.* The following conditions, speeds, and aileron deflections (except as the deflections may be limited by pilot effort) must be considered in combination with an airplane load factor of zero and of two-thirds of the positive maneuvering factor used in design. In determining the required aileron deflections, the torsional flexibility of the wing must be considered in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.301   Loads.\|§25.301]](b):

\(1\) Conditions corresponding to steady rolling velocities must be investigated. In addition, conditions corresponding to maximum angular acceleration must be investigated for airplanes with engines or other weight concentrations outboard of the fuselage. For the angular acceleration conditions, zero rolling velocity may be assumed in the absence of a rational time history investigation of the maneuver.

\(2\) At *VA,* a sudden deflection of the aileron to the stop is assumed.

\(3\) At *VC,* the aileron deflection must be that required to produce a rate of roll not less than that obtained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

\(4\) At *VD,* the aileron deflection must be that required to produce a rate of roll not less than one-third of that in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

\(b\) *Unsymmetrical gusts.* The airplane is assumed to be subjected to unsymmetrical vertical gusts in level flight. The resulting limit loads must be determined from either the wing maximum airload derived directly from [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a), or the wing maximum airload derived indirectly from the vertical load factor calculated from [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a). It must be assumed that 100 percent of the wing air load acts on one side of the airplane and 80 percent of the wing air load acts on the other side.

### §25.351   Yaw maneuver conditions.

The airplane must be designed for loads resulting from the yaw maneuver conditions specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section at speeds from VMC to VD. Unbalanced aerodynamic moments about the center of gravity must be reacted in a rational or conservative manner considering the airplane inertia forces. In computing the tail loads the yawing velocity may be assumed to be zero.

\(a\) With the airplane in unaccelerated flight at zero yaw, it is assumed that the cockpit rudder control is suddenly displaced to achieve the resulting rudder deflection, as limited by:

\(1\) The control system on control surface stops; or

\(2\) A limit pilot force of 300 pounds from VMC to VA and 200 pounds from VC/MC to VD/MD, with a linear variation between VA and VC/MC.

\(b\) With the cockpit rudder control deflected so as always to maintain the maximum rudder deflection available within the limitations specified in paragraph (a) of this section, it is assumed that the airplane yaws to the overswing sideslip angle.

\(c\) With the airplane yawed to the static equilibrium sideslip angle, it is assumed that the cockpit rudder control is held so as to achieve the maximum rudder deflection available within the limitations specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

\(d\) With the airplane yawed to the static equilibrium sideslip angle of paragraph (c) of this section, it is assumed that the cockpit rudder control is suddenly returned to neutral.

Any permanent deformation from these ultimate load conditions must not prevent continued safe flight and landing.

\(b\) The ultimate loads developed from the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section are to be—

### §25.365   Pressurized compartment loads.

For airplanes with one or more pressurized compartments the following apply:

\(a\) The airplane structure must be strong enough to withstand the flight loads combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum relief valve setting.

\(b\) The external pressure distribution in flight, and stress concentrations and fatigue effects must be accounted for.

\(c\) If landings may be made with the compartment pressurized, landing loads must be combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum allowed during landing.

\(d\) The airplane structure must be designed to be able to withstand the pressure differential loads corresponding to the maximum relief valve setting multiplied by a factor of 1.33 for airplanes to be approved for operation to 45,000 feet or by a factor of 1.67 for airplanes to be approved for operation above 45,000 feet, omitting other loads.

The size Ho must be computed by the following formula:

\(3\) The maximum opening caused by airplane or equipment failures not shown to be extremely improbable.

\(f\) In complying with paragraph (e) of this section, the fail-safe features of the design may be considered in determining the probability of failure or penetration and probable size of openings, provided that possible improper operation of closure devices and inadvertent door openings are also considered. Furthermore, the resulting differential pressure loads must be combined in a rational and conservative manner with 1-g level flight loads and any loads arising from emergency depressurization conditions. These loads may be considered as ultimate conditions; however, any deformations associated with these conditions must not interfere with continued safe flight and landing. The pressure relief provided by intercompartment venting may also be considered.

\(g\) Bulkheads, floors, and partitions in pressurized compartments for occupants must be designed to withstand the conditions specified in paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, reasonable design precautions must be taken to minimize the probability of parts becoming detached and injuring occupants while in their seats.

\(a\) The airplane must be designed for the unsymmetrical loads resulting from the failure of the critical engine. Turbopropeller airplanes must be designed for the following conditions in combination with a single malfunction of the propeller drag limiting system, considering the probable pilot corrective action on the flight controls:

\(2\) At speeds between *VMC* and *VC,* the loads resulting from the disconnection of the engine compressor from the turbine or from loss of the turbine blades are considered to be ultimate loads.

\(3\) The time history of the thrust decay and drag build-up occurring as a result of the prescribed engine failures must be substantiated by test or other data applicable to the particular engine-propeller combination.

\(4\) The timing and magnitude of the probable pilot corrective action must be conservatively estimated, considering the characteristics of the particular engine-propeller-airplane combination.

\(b\) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the time maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than two seconds after the engine failure.

\(b\) For aileron and rudder trim tabs, those required to trim the airplane in the critical unsymmetrical power and loading conditions, with appropriate allowance for rigging tolerances.

### §25.409   Tabs.

\(a\) *Trim tabs.* Trim tabs must be designed to withstand loads arising from all likely combinations of tab setting, primary control position, and airplane speed (obtainable without exceeding the flight load conditions prescribed for the airplane as a whole), when the effect of the tab is opposed by pilot effort forces up to those specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.397   Control system loads.\|§25.397]](b).

\(b\) *Balancing tabs.* Balancing tabs must be designed for deflections consistent with the primary control surface loading conditions.

\(c\) *Servo tabs.* Servo tabs must be designed for deflections consistent with the primary control surface loading conditions obtainable within the pilot maneuvering effort, considering possible opposition from the trim tabs.

### §25.415   Ground gust conditions.

\(a\) The flight control systems and surfaces must be designed for the limit loads generated when the airplane is subjected to a horizontal 65-knot ground gust from any direction while taxiing and while parked. For airplanes equipped with control system gust locks, the taxiing condition must be evaluated with the controls locked and unlocked, and the parked condition must be evaluated with the controls locked.

\(b\) The control system and surface loads due to ground gust may be assumed to be static loads, and the hinge moments H must be computed from the formula:

H = K (1/2) ρo V2 c S

\(c\) The hinge moment factor K for ground gusts must be taken from the following table:

</div>

\(d\) The computed hinge moment of paragraph (b) of this section must be used to determine the limit loads due to ground gust conditions for the control surface. A 1.25 factor on the computed hinge moments must be used in calculating limit control system loads.

\(e\) Where control system flexibility is such that the rate of load application in the ground gust conditions might produce transient stresses appreciably higher than those corresponding to static loads, in the absence of a rational analysis substantiating a different dynamic factor, an additional factor of 1.6 must be applied to the control system loads of paragraph (d) of this section to obtain limit loads. If a rational analysis is used, the additional factor must not be less than 1.2.

\(f\) For the condition of the control locks engaged, the control surfaces, the control system locks, and the parts of any control systems between the surfaces and the locks must be designed to the resultant limit loads. Where control locks are not provided, then the control surfaces, the control system stops nearest the surfaces, and the parts of any control systems between the surfaces and the stops must be designed to the resultant limit loads. If the control system design is such as to allow any part of the control system to impact with the stops due to flexibility, then the resultant impact loads must be taken into account in deriving the limit loads due to ground gust.

\(g\) For the condition of taxiing with the control locks disengaged, or where control locks are not provided, the following apply:

\(1\) The control surfaces, the control system stops nearest the surfaces, and the parts of any control systems between the surfaces and the stops must be designed to the resultant limit loads.

\(2\) The parts of the control systems between the stops nearest the surfaces and the flight deck controls must be designed to the resultant limit loads, except that the parts of the control system where loads are eventually reacted by the pilot need not exceed:

\(i\) The loads corresponding to the maximum pilot loads in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.397   Control system loads.\|§25.397]](c) for each pilot alone; or

\(b\) The horizontal tail must be assumed to be subjected to unsymmetrical loading conditions determined as follows:

\(1\) 100 percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical maneuver conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.331   Symmetric maneuvering conditions.\|§25.331]] and the vertical gust conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a) acting separately on the surface on one side of the plane of symmetry; and

\(2\) 80 percent of these loadings acting on the other side.

\(c\) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces have dihedral angles greater than plus or minus 10 degrees, or are supported by the vertical tail surfaces, the surfaces and the supporting structure must be designed for gust velocities specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a) acting in any orientation at right angles to the flight path.

\(d\) Unsymmetrical loading on the empennage arising from buffet conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.305   Strength and deformation.\|§25.305]](e) must be taken into account.

\[Doc. No. 27902, 61 FR 5222, Feb. 9, 1996\]

### §25.445   Auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces.

\(a\) When significant, the aerodynamic influence between auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces, such as outboard fins and winglets, and their supporting aerodynamic surfaces, must be taken into account for all loading conditions including pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers, and gusts as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]](a) acting at any orientation at right angles to the flight path.

\(b\) To provide for unsymmetrical loading when outboard fins extend above and below the horizontal surface, the critical vertical surface loading (load per unit area) determined under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.391   Control surface loads: General.\|§25.391]] must also be applied as follows:

\(1\) 100 percent to the area of the vertical surfaces above (or below) the horizontal surface.

\(2\) 80 percent to the area below (or above) the horizontal surface.

### §25.457   Wing flaps.

### Ground Loads

### §25.471   General.

\(a\) *Loads and equilibrium.* For limit ground loads—

\(1\) Limit ground loads obtained under this subpart are considered to be external forces applied to the airplane structure; and

\(2\) In each specified ground load condition, the external loads must be placed in equilibrium with the linear and angular inertia loads in a rational or conservative manner.

\(b\) *Critical centers of gravity.* The critical centers of gravity within the range for which certification is requested must be selected so that the maximum design loads are obtained in each landing gear element. Fore and aft, vertical, and lateral airplane centers of gravity must be considered. Lateral displacements of the c.g. from the airplane centerline which would result in main gear loads not greater than 103 percent of the critical design load for symmetrical loading conditions may be selected without considering the effects of these lateral c.g. displacements on the loading of the main gear elements, or on the airplane structure provided—

\(1\) The lateral displacement of the c.g. results from random passenger or cargo disposition within the fuselage or from random unsymmetrical fuel loading or fuel usage; and

\(2\) Appropriate loading instructions for random disposable loads are included under the provisions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1583   Operating limitations.\|§25.1583]](c)(1) to ensure that the lateral displacement of the center of gravity is maintained within these limits.

\(2\) With a limit descent velocity of 10 fps at the design landing weight (the maximum weight for landing conditions at maximum descent velocity); and

\(3\) With a limit descent velocity of 6 fps at the design take-off weight (the maximum weight for landing conditions at a reduced descent velocity).

\(4\) The prescribed descent velocities may be modified if it is shown that the airplane has design features that make it impossible to develop these velocities.

\(d\) In addition to the loading conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, but with maximum vertical ground reactions calculated from paragraph (a), the following apply:

\(1\) The landing gear and directly affected attaching structure must be designed for the maximum vertical ground reaction combined with an aft acting drag component of not less than 25% of this maximum vertical ground reaction.

\(2\) The most severe combination of loads that are likely to arise during a lateral drift landing must be taken into account. In absence of a more rational analysis of this condition, the following must be investigated:

\(i\) A vertical load equal to 75% of the maximum ground reaction of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.473   Landing load conditions and assumptions.\|§25.473]] must be considered in combination with a drag and side load of 40% and 25% respectively of that vertical load.

\(b\) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with tail wheels, the main and tail wheels are assumed to contact the ground simultaneously, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix A. Ground reaction conditions on the tail wheel are assumed to act—

\(1\) Vertically; and

\(2\) Up and aft through the axle at 45 degrees to the ground line.

\(c\) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with nose wheels, the airplane is assumed to be at an attitude corresponding to either the stalling angle or the maximum angle allowing clearance with the ground by each part of the airplane other than the main wheels, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix A, whichever is less.

### §25.483   One-gear landing conditions.

For the one-gear landing conditions, the airplane is assumed to be in the level attitude and to contact the ground on one main landing gear, in accordance with Figure 4 of Appendix A of this part. In this attitude—

\(a\) The ground reactions must be the same as those obtained on that side under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.479   Level landing conditions.\|§25.479]](d)(1), and

\(b\) Each unbalanced external load must be reacted by airplane inertia in a rational or conservative manner.

In addition to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.479   Level landing conditions.\|§25.479]](d)(2) the following conditions must be considered:

\(a\) For the side load condition, the airplane is assumed to be in the level attitude with only the main wheels contacting the ground, in accordance with figure 5 of appendix A.

\(b\) Side loads of 0.8 of the vertical reaction (on one side) acting inward and 0.6 of the vertical reaction (on the other side) acting outward must be combined with one-half of the maximum vertical ground reactions obtained in the level landing conditions. These loads are assumed to be applied at the ground contact point and to be resisted by the inertia of the airplane. The drag loads may be assumed to be zero.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-91, 62 FR 40705, July 29, 1997\]

### §25.487   Rebound landing condition.

\(a\) The landing gear and its supporting structure must be investigated for the loads occurring during rebound of the airplane from the landing surface.

\(b\) With the landing gear fully extended and not in contact with the ground, a load factor of 20.0 must act on the unsprung weights of the landing gear. This load factor must act in the direction of motion of the unsprung weights as they reach their limiting positions in extending with relation to the sprung parts of the landing gear.

### §25.489   Ground handling conditions.

Unless otherwise prescribed, the landing gear and airplane structure must be investigated for the conditions in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.491   Taxi, takeoff and landing roll.\|§§25.491]] through 25.509 with the airplane at the design ramp weight (the maximum weight for ground handling conditions). No wing lift may be considered. The shock absorbers and tires may be assumed to be in their static position.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5673, Apr. 8, 1970\]

### §25.493   Braked roll conditions.

\(a\) An airplane with a tail wheel is assumed to be in the level attitude with the load on the main wheels, in accordance with figure 6 of appendix A.

A drag reaction equal to the vertical reaction multiplied by a coefficient of friction of 0.8, must be combined with the vertical ground reaction and applied at the ground contact point.

\(b\) For an airplane with a nose wheel the limit vertical load factor is 1.2 at the design landing weight, and 1.0 at the design ramp weight. A drag reaction equal to the vertical reaction, multiplied by a coefficient of friction of 0.8, must be combined with the vertical reaction and applied at the ground contact point of each wheel with brakes. The following two attitudes, in accordance with figure 6 of appendix A, must be considered:

\(1\) The level attitude with the wheels contacting the ground and the loads distributed between the main and nose gear. Zero pitching acceleration is assumed.

\(2\) The level attitude with only the main gear contacting the ground and with the pitching moment resisted by angular acceleration.

\(c\) A drag reaction lower than that prescribed in this section may be used if it is substantiated that an effective drag force of 0.8 times the vertical reaction cannot be attained under any likely loading condition.

\(d\) An airplane equipped with a nose gear must be designed to withstand the loads arising from the dynamic pitching motion of the airplane due to sudden application of maximum braking force. The airplane is considered to be at design takeoff weight with the nose and main gears in contact with the ground, and with a steady-state vertical load factor of 1.0. The steady-state nose gear reaction must be combined with the maximum incremental nose gear vertical reaction caused by the sudden application of maximum braking force as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

\(e\) In the absence of a more rational analysis, the nose gear vertical reaction prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section must be calculated according to the following formula:

### §25.499   Nose-wheel yaw and steering.

\(a\) A vertical load factor of 1.0 at the airplane center of gravity, and a side component at the nose wheel ground contact equal to 0.8 of the vertical ground reaction at that point are assumed.

\(b\) With the airplane assumed to be in static equilibrium with the loads resulting from the use of brakes on one side of the main landing gear, the nose gear, its attaching structure, and the fuselage structure forward of the center of gravity must be designed for the following loads:

\(1\) A vertical load factor at the center of gravity of 1.0.

\(2\) A forward acting load at the airplane center of gravity of 0.8 times the vertical load on one main gear.

\(3\) Side and vertical loads at the ground contact point on the nose gear that are required for static equilibrium.

\(4\) A side load factor at the airplane center of gravity of zero.

\(c\) If the loads prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section result in a nose gear side load higher than 0.8 times the vertical nose gear load, the design nose gear side load may be limited to 0.8 times the vertical load, with unbalanced yawing moments assumed to be resisted by airplane inertia forces.

\(d\) For other than the nose gear, its attaching structure, and the forward fuselage structure, the loading conditions are those prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, except that—

\(1\) A lower drag reaction may be used if an effective drag force of 0.8 times the vertical reaction cannot be reached under any likely loading condition; and

\(2\) The forward acting load at the center of gravity need not exceed the maximum drag reaction on one main gear, determined in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.493   Braked roll conditions.\|§25.493]](b).

\(e\) With the airplane at design ramp weight, and the nose gear in any steerable position, the combined application of full normal steering torque and vertical force equal to 1.33 times the maximum static reaction on the nose gear must be considered in designing the nose gear, its attaching structure, and the forward fuselage structure.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5673, Apr. 8, 1970; Amdt. 25-46, 43 FR 50595, Oct. 30, 1978; Amdt. 25-91, 62 FR 40705, July 29, 1997\]

### §25.503   Pivoting.

\(b\) The airplane is assumed to be in static equilibrium, with the loads being applied at the ground contact points, in accordance with figure 8 of appendix A.

### §25.507   Reversed braking.

\(a\) The airplane must be in a three point static ground attitude. Horizontal reactions parallel to the ground and directed forward must be applied at the ground contact point of each wheel with brakes. The limit loads must be equal to 0.55 times the vertical load at each wheel or to the load developed by 1.2 times the nominal maximum static brake torque, whichever is less.

\(b\) For airplanes with nose wheels, the pitching moment must be balanced by rotational inertia.

\(c\) For airplanes with tail wheels, the resultant of the ground reactions must pass through the center of gravity of the airplane.

### §25.509   Towing loads.

\(a\) The towing loads specified in paragraph (d) of this section must be considered separately. These loads must be applied at the towing fittings and must act parallel to the ground. In addition—

\(1\) A vertical load factor equal to 1.0 must be considered acting at the center of gravity;

\(ii\) (*6WT* + 450,000)/70 for *WT* between 30,000 and 100,000 pounds; and

\(iii\) 0.15 *WT* for *WT* over 100,000 pounds.

\(b\) For towing points not on the landing gear but near the plane of symmetry of the airplane, the drag and side tow load components specified for the auxiliary gear apply. For towing points located outboard of the main gear, the drag and side tow load components specified for the main gear apply. Where the specified angle of swivel cannot be reached, the maximum obtainable angle must be used.

\(c\) The towing loads specified in paragraph (d) of this section must be reacted as follows:

\(1\) The side component of the towing load at the main gear must be reacted by a side force at the static ground line of the wheel to which the load is applied.

\(2\) The towing loads at the auxiliary gear and the drag components of the towing loads at the main gear must be reacted as follows:

\(i\) A reaction with a maximum value equal to the vertical reaction must be applied at the axle of the wheel to which the load is applied. Enough airplane inertia to achieve equilibrium must be applied.

### §25.511   Ground load: unsymmetrical loads on multiple-wheel units.

\(a\) *General.* Multiple-wheel landing gear units are assumed to be subjected to the limit ground loads prescribed in this subpart under paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. In addition—

\(1\) A tandem strut gear arrangement is a multiple-wheel unit; and

\(2\) In determining the total load on a gear unit with respect to the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, the transverse shift in the load centroid, due to unsymmetrical load distribution on the wheels, may be neglected.

\(b\) *Distribution of limit loads to wheels; tires inflated.* The distribution of the limit loads among the wheels of the landing gear must be established for each landing, taxiing, and ground handling condition, taking into account the effects of the following factors:

\(1\) The number of wheels and their physical arrangements. For truck type landing gear units, the effects of any seesaw motion of the truck during the landing impact must be considered in determining the maximum design loads for the fore and aft wheel pairs.

\(2\) Any differentials in tire diameters resulting from a combination of manufacturing tolerances, tire growth, and tire wear. A maximum tire-diameter differential equal to 2⁄3 of the most unfavorable combination of diameter variations that is obtained when taking into account manufacturing tolerances, tire growth, and tire wear, may be assumed.

\(3\) Any unequal tire inflation pressure, assuming the maximum variation to be ±5 percent of the nominal tire inflation pressure.

\(4\) A runway crown of zero and a runway crown having a convex upward shape that may be approximated by a slope of 11⁄2 percent with the horizontal. Runway crown effects must be considered with the nose gear unit on either slope of the crown.

\(5\) The airplane attitude.

\(6\) Any structural deflections.

\(c\) *Deflated tires.* The effect of deflated tires on the structure must be considered with respect to the loading conditions specified in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, taking into account the physical arrangement of the gear components. In addition—

\(1\) The deflation of any one tire for each multiple wheel landing gear unit, and the deflation of any two critical tires for each landing gear unit using four or more wheels per unit, must be considered; and

\(2\) The ground reactions must be applied to the wheels with inflated tires except that, for multiple-wheel gear units with more than one shock strut, a rational distribution of the ground reactions between the deflated and inflated tires, accounting for the differences in shock strut extensions resulting from a deflated tire, may be used.

\(d\) *Landing conditions.* For one and for two deflated tires, the applied load to each gear unit is assumed to be 60 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of the limit load applied to each gear for each of the prescribed landing conditions. However, for the drift landing condition of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.485   Side load conditions.\|§25.485]], 100 percent of the vertical load must be applied.

\(e\) *Taxiing and ground handling conditions.* For one and for two deflated tires—

\(1\) The applied side or drag load factor, or both factors, at the center of gravity must be the most critical value up to 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of the limit side or drag load factors, or both factors, corresponding to the most severe condition resulting from consideration of the prescribed taxiing and ground handling conditions;

\(2\) For the braked roll conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.493   Braked roll conditions.\|§25.493]] (a) and (b)(2), the drag loads on each inflated tire may not be less than those at each tire for the symmetrical load distribution with no deflated tires;

\(3\) The vertical load factor at the center of gravity must be 60 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of the factor with no deflated tires, except that it may not be less than 1g; and

\(4\) Pivoting need not be considered.

\(f\) *Towing conditions.* For one and for two deflated tires, the towing load, *FTOW,* must be 60 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of the load prescribed.

### §25.519   Jacking and tie-down provisions.

\(a\) General. The airplane must be designed to withstand the limit load conditions resulting from the static ground load conditions of paragraph (b) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this section at the most critical combinations of airplane weight and center of gravity. The maximum allowable load at each jack pad must be specified.

\(b\) Jacking. The airplane must have provisions for jacking and must withstand the following limit loads when the airplane is supported on jacks—

\(1\) For jacking by the landing gear at the maximum ramp weight of the airplane, the airplane structure must be designed for a vertical load of 1.33 times the vertical static reaction at each jacking point acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction applied in any direction.

\(2\) For jacking by other airplane structure at maximum approved jacking weight:

\(i\) The airplane structure must be designed for a vertical load of 1.33 times the vertical reaction at each jacking point acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction applied in any direction.

\(ii\) The jacking pads and local structure must be designed for a vertical load of 2.0 times the vertical static reaction at each jacking point, acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction applied in any direction.

\(c\) Tie-down. If tie-down points are provided, the main tie-down points and local structure must withstand the limit loads resulting from a 65-knot horizontal wind from any direction.

\[Doc. No. 26129, 59 FR 22102, Apr. 28, 1994\]

### Water Loads

### §25.521   General.

\(a\) Seaplanes must be designed for the water loads developed during takeoff and landing, with the seaplane in any attitude likely to occur in normal operation, and at the appropriate forward and sinking velocities under the most severe sea conditions likely to be encountered.

\(b\) Unless a more rational analysis of the water loads is made, or the standards in ANC-3 are used, [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.523   Design weights and center of gravity positions.\|§§25.523]] through 25.537 apply.

\(c\) The requirements of this section and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.523   Design weights and center of gravity positions.\|§§25.523]] through 25.537 apply also to amphibians.

### §25.523   Design weights and center of gravity positions.

\(a\) *Design weights.* The water load requirements must be met at each operating weight up to the design landing weight except that, for the takeoff condition prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.531   Hull and main float takeoff condition.\|§25.531]], the design water takeoff weight (the maximum weight for water taxi and takeoff run) must be used.

\(b\) *Center of gravity positions.* The critical centers of gravity within the limits for which certification is requested must be considered to reach maximum design loads for each part of the seaplane structure.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5673, Apr. 8, 1970\]

### §25.525   Application of loads.

\(a\) Unless otherwise prescribed, the seaplane as a whole is assumed to be subjected to the loads corresponding to the load factors specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.527   Hull and main float load factors.\|§25.527]].

\(b\) In applying the loads resulting from the load factors prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.527   Hull and main float load factors.\|§25.527]], the loads may be distributed over the hull or main float bottom (in order to avoid excessive local shear loads and bending moments at the location of water load application) using pressures not less than those prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.533   Hull and main float bottom pressures.\|§25.533]](b).

\(c\) For twin float seaplanes, each float must be treated as an equivalent hull on a fictitious seaplane with a weight equal to one-half the weight of the twin float seaplane.

\(d\) Except in the takeoff condition of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.531   Hull and main float takeoff condition.\|§25.531]], the aerodynamic lift on the seaplane during the impact is assumed to be 2⁄3 of the weight of the seaplane.

### §25.527   Hull and main float load factors.

\(a\) Water reaction load factors *nW* must be computed in the following manner:

\(1\) For the step landing case

![eCFR graphic ec28se91.036.gif](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/ec28se91.036.gif)

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.036.pdf)

\(2\) For the bow and stern landing cases

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.037.pdf)

\(b\) The following values are used:

\(1\) *nW* = water reaction load factor (that is, the water reaction divided by seaplane weight).

\(2\) *C*1 = empirical seaplane operations factor equal to 0.012 (except that this factor may not be less than that necessary to obtain the minimum value of step load factor of 2.33).

\(3\) *VS*0 = seaplane stalling speed in knots with flaps extended in the appropriate landing position and with no slipstream effect.

\(4\) β = angle of dead rise at the longitudinal station at which the load factor is being determined in accordance with figure 1 of appendix B.

\(5\) *W=* seaplane design landing weight in pounds.

\(6\) *K*1 = empirical hull station weighing factor, in accordance with figure 2 of appendix B.

\(7\) *rx* = ratio of distance, measured parallel to hull reference axis, from the center of gravity of the seaplane to the hull longitudinal station at which the load factor is being computed to the radius of gyration in pitch of the seaplane, the hull reference axis being a straight line, in the plane of symmetry, tangential to the keel at the main step.

\(c\) For a twin float seaplane, because of the effect of flexibility of the attachment of the floats to the seaplane, the factor *K*1 may be reduced at the bow and stern to 0.8 of the value shown in figure 2 of appendix B. This reduction applies only to the design of the carrythrough and seaplane structure.

### §25.529   Hull and main float landing conditions.

\(a\) *Symmetrical step, bow, and stern landing.* For symmetrical step, bow, and stern landings, the limit water reaction load factors are those computed under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.527   Hull and main float load factors.\|§25.527]]. In addition—

\(1\) For symmetrical step landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, through the center of gravity, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line;

\(2\) For symmetrical bow landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, one-fifth of the longitudinal distance from the bow to the step, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line; and

\(3\) For symmetrical stern landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, at a point 85 percent of the longitudinal distance from the step to the stern post, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line.

\(b\) *Unsymmetrical landing for hull and single float seaplanes.* Unsymmetrical step, bow, and stern landing conditions must be investigated. In addition—

\(1\) The loading for each condition consists of an upward component and a side component equal, respectively, to 0.75 and 0.25 tan β times the resultant load in the corresponding symmetrical landing condition; and

\(2\) The point of application and direction of the upward component of the load is the same as that in the symmetrical condition, and the point of application of the side component is at the same longitudinal station as the upward component but is directed inward perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry at a point midway between the keel and chine lines.

\(c\) *Unsymmetrical landing; twin float seaplanes.* The unsymmetrical loading consists of an upward load at the step of each float of 0.75 and a side load of 0.25 tan β at one float times the step landing load reached under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.527   Hull and main float load factors.\|§25.527]]. The side load is directed inboard, perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry midway between the keel and chine lines of the float, at the same longitudinal station as the upward load.

### §25.531   Hull and main float takeoff condition.

For the wing and its attachment to the hull or main float—

\(a\) The aerodynamic wing lift is assumed to be zero; and

\(b\) A downward inertia load, corresponding to a load factor computed from the following formula, must be applied:

\(c\) *Bow loading.* The resultant limit load must be applied in the plane of symmetry of the float at a point one-fourth of the distance from the bow to the step and must be perpendicular to the tangent to the keel line at that point. The magnitude of the resultant load is that specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

\(d\) *Unsymmetrical step loading.* The resultant water load consists of a component equal to 0.75 times the load specified in paragraph (a) of this section and a side component equal to 3.25 tan β times the load specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The side load must be applied perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry of the float at a point midway between the keel and the chine.

### §25.561   General.

\(a\) The airplane, although it may be damaged in emergency landing conditions on land or water, must be designed as prescribed in this section to protect each occupant under those conditions.

\(b\) The structure must be designed to give each occupant every reasonable chance of escaping serious injury in a minor crash landing when—

\(1\) Proper use is made of seats, belts, and all other safety design provisions;

\(2\) The wheels are retracted (where applicable); and

\(3\) The occupant experiences the following ultimate inertia forces acting separately relative to the surrounding structure:

\(i\) Upward, 3.0g

\(ii\) Forward, 9.0g

\(iii\) Sideward, 3.0g on the airframe; and 4.0g on the seats and their attachments.

\(iv\) Downward, 6.0g

\(v\) Rearward, 1.5g

\(c\) For equipment, cargo in the passenger compartments and any other large masses, the following apply:

\(i\) Cause direct injury to occupants;

\(ii\) Penetrate fuel tanks or lines or cause fire or explosion hazard by damage to adjacent systems; or

\(iii\) Nullify any of the escape facilities provided for use after an emergency landing.

\(2\) When such positioning is not practical (e.g. fuselage mounted engines or auxiliary power units) each such item of mass shall be restrained under all loads up to those specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The local attachments for these items should be designed to withstand 1.33 times the specified loads if these items are subject to severe wear and tear through frequent removal (e.g. quick change interior items).

\(d\) Seats and items of mass (and their supporting structure) must not deform under any loads up to those specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section in any manner that would impede subsequent rapid evacuation of occupants.

### §25.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.

\(a\) The seat and restraint system in the airplane must be designed as prescribed in this section to protect each occupant during an emergency landing condition when—

\(1\) Proper use is made of seats, safety belts, and shoulder harnesses provided for in the design; and

\(2\) The occupant is exposed to loads resulting from the conditions prescribed in this section.

\(b\) Each seat type design approved for crew or passenger occupancy during takeoff and landing must successfully complete dynamic tests or be demonstrated by rational analysis based on dynamic tests of a similar type seat, in accordance with each of the following emergency landing conditions. The tests must be conducted with an occupant simulated by a 170-pound anthropomorphic test dummy, as defined by 49 CFR Part 572, Subpart B, or its equivalent, sitting in the normal upright position.

\(1\) A change in downward vertical velocity (Δ v) of not less than 35 feet per second, with the airplane's longitudinal axis canted downward 30 degrees with respect to the horizontal plane and with the wings level. Peak floor deceleration must occur in not more than 0.08 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 14g.

\(2\) A change in forward longitudinal velocity (Δ v) of not less than 44 feet per second, with the airplane's longitudinal axis horizontal and yawed 10 degrees either right or left, whichever would cause the greatest likelihood of the upper torso restraint system (where installed) moving off the occupant's shoulder, and with the wings level. Peak floor deceleration must occur in not more than 0.09 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 16g. Where floor rails or floor fittings are used to attach the seating devices to the test fixture, the rails or fittings must be misaligned with respect to the adjacent set of rails or fittings by at least 10 degrees vertically (*i.e.*, out of Parallel) with one rolled 10 degrees.

\(c\) The following performance measures must not be exceeded during the dynamic tests conducted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:

\(2\) The maximum compressive load measured between the pelvis and the lumbar column of the anthropomorphic dummy must not exceed 1,500 pounds.

\(3\) The upper torso restraint straps (where installed) must remain on the occupant's shoulder during the impact.

\(4\) The lap safety belt must remain on the occupant's pelvis during the impact.

\(5\) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Where head contact with seats or other structure can occur, protection must be provided so that the head impact does not exceed a Head Injury Criterion (HIC) of 1,000 units. The level of HIC is defined by the equation:

![eCFR graphic ec28se91.044.gif](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/ec28se91.044.gif)

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.044.pdf)

\(6\) Where leg injuries may result from contact with seats or other structure, protection must be provided to prevent axially compressive loads exceeding 2,250 pounds in each femur.

\(7\) The seat must remain attached at all points of attachment, although the structure may have yielded.

\(8\) Seats must not yield under the tests specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section to the extent they would impede rapid evacuation of the airplane occupants.

\[Amdt. 25-64, 53 FR 17646, May 17, 1988\]

### §25.563   Structural ditching provisions.

Structural strength considerations of ditching provisions must be in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.801   Ditching.\|§25.801]](e).

### Fatigue Evaluation

### §25.571   Damage—tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.

\(a\) *General.* An evaluation of the strength, detail design, and fabrication must show that catastrophic failure due to fatigue, corrosion, manufacturing defects, or accidental damage, will be avoided throughout the operational life of the airplane. This evaluation must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, for each part of the structure that could contribute to a catastrophic failure (such as wing, empennage, control surfaces and their systems, the fuselage, engine mounting, landing gear, and their related primary attachments). For turbojet powered airplanes, those parts that could contribute to a catastrophic failure must also be evaluated under paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, the following apply:

\(1\) Each evaluation required by this section must include—

\(i\) The typical loading spectra, temperatures, and humidities expected in service;

\(ii\) The identification of principal structural elements and detail design points, the failure of which could cause catastrophic failure of the airplane; and

\(iii\) An analysis, supported by test evidence, of the principal structural elements and detail design points identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

\(2\) The service history of airplanes of similar structural design, taking due account of differences in operating conditions and procedures, may be used in the evaluations required by this section.

\(3\) Based on the evaluations required by this section, inspections or other procedures must be established, as necessary, to prevent catastrophic failure, and must be included in the Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1529   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§25.1529]]. The limit of validity of the engineering data that supports the structural maintenance program (hereafter referred to as LOV), stated as a number of total accumulated flight cycles or flight hours or both, established by this section must also be included in the Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1529   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§25.1529]]. Inspection thresholds for the following types of structure must be established based on crack growth analyses and/or tests, assuming the structure contains an initial flaw of the maximum probable size that could exist as a result of manufacturing or service-induced damage:

\(i\) Single load path structure, and

\(ii\) Multiple load path “fail-safe” structure and crack arrest “fail-safe” structure, where it cannot be demonstrated that load path failure, partial failure, or crack arrest will be detected and repaired during normal maintenance, inspection, or operation of an airplane prior to failure of the remaining structure.

\(b\) *Damage-tolerance evaluation.* The evaluation must include a determination of the probable locations and modes of damage due to fatigue, corrosion, or accidental damage. Repeated load and static analyses supported by test evidence and (if available) service experience must also be incorporated in the evaluation. Special consideration for widespread fatigue damage must be included where the design is such that this type of damage could occur. An LOV must be established that corresponds to the period of time, stated as a number of total accumulated flight cycles or flight hours or both, during which it is demonstrated that widespread fatigue damage will not occur in the airplane structure. This demonstration must be by full-scale fatigue test evidence. The type certificate may be issued prior to completion of full-scale fatigue testing, provided the Administrator has approved a plan for completing the required tests. In that case, the Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1529   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§25.1529]] must specify that no airplane may be operated beyond a number of cycles equal to 1⁄2 the number of cycles accumulated on the fatigue test article, until such testing is completed. The extent of damage for residual strength evaluation at any time within the operational life of the airplane must be consistent with the initial detectability and subsequent growth under repeated loads. The residual strength evaluation must show that the remaining structure is able to withstand loads (considered as static ultimate loads) corresponding to the following conditions:

\(1\) The limit symmetrical maneuvering conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.337   Limit maneuvering load factors.\|§25.337]] at all speeds up to Vc and in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.345   High lift devices.\|§25.345]].

\(2\) The limit gust conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.341   Gust and turbulence loads.\|§25.341]] at the specified speeds up to VC and in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.345   High lift devices.\|§25.345]].

\(3\) The limit rolling conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.349   Rolling conditions.\|§25.349]] and the limit unsymmetrical conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.367   Unsymmetrical loads due to engine failure.\|§§25.367]] and 25.427 (a) through (c), at speeds up to VC.

\(4\) The limit yaw maneuvering conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.351   Yaw maneuver conditions.\|§25.351]](a) at the specified speeds up to VC.

\(5\) For pressurized cabins, the following conditions:

\(i\) The normal operating differential pressure combined with the expected external aerodynamic pressures applied simultaneously with the flight loading conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, if they have a significant effect.

\(ii\) The maximum value of normal operating differential pressure (including the expected external aerodynamic pressures during 1 g level flight) multiplied by a factor of 1.15, omitting other loads.

\(6\) For landing gear and directly-affected airframe structure, the limit ground loading conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.473   Landing load conditions and assumptions.\|§§25.473]], 25.491, and 25.493.

\(c\) *Fatigue (safe-life) evaluation.* Compliance with the damage-tolerance requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is not required if the applicant establishes that their application for particular structure is impractical. This structure must be shown by analysis, supported by test evidence, to be able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected during its service life without detectable cracks. Appropriate safe-life scatter factors must be applied.

\(d\) *Sonic fatigue strength.* It must be shown by analysis, supported by test evidence, or by the service history of airplanes of similar structural design and sonic excitation environment, that—

\(1\) Sonic fatigue cracks are not probable in any part of the flight structure subject to sonic excitation; or

\(2\) Catastrophic failure caused by sonic cracks is not probable assuming that the loads prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section are applied to all areas affected by those cracks.

\(e\) *Damage-tolerance (discrete source) evaluation.* The airplane must be capable of successfully completing a flight during which likely structural damage occurs as a result of—

\(1\) Impact with a 4-pound bird when the velocity of the airplane relative to the bird along the airplane's flight path is equal to Vc at sea level or 0.85Vc at 8,000 feet, whichever is more critical;

\(2\) Uncontained fan blade impact;

\(3\) Uncontained engine failure; or

\(4\) Uncontained high energy rotating machinery failure.

\(c\) Take into account the effects of environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, expected in service.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-38, 41 FR 55466, Dec. 20, 1976; Amdt. 25-46, 43 FR 50595, Oct. 30, 1978\]

### §25.605   Fabrication methods.

\(a\) The methods of fabrication used must produce a consistently sound structure. If a fabrication process (such as gluing, spot welding, or heat treating) requires close control to reach this objective, the process must be performed under an approved process specification.

\(b\) Each new aircraft fabrication method must be substantiated by a test program.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-46, 43 FR 50595, Oct. 30, 1978\]

### §25.607   Fasteners.

\(a\) Each removable bolt, screw, nut, pin, or other removable fastener must incorporate two separate locking devices if—

\(1\) Its loss could preclude continued flight and landing within the design limitations of the airplane using normal pilot skill and strength; or

\(2\) Its loss could result in reduction in pitch, yaw, or roll control capability or response below that required by Subpart B of this chapter.

\(b\) The fasteners specified in paragraph (a) of this section and their locking devices may not be adversely affected by the environmental conditions associated with the particular installation.

\(c\) No self-locking nut may be used on any bolt subject to rotation in operation unless a nonfriction locking device is used in addition to the self-locking device.

\[Amdt. 25-23, 35 FR 5674, Apr. 8, 1970\]

\(a\) Material strength properties must be based on enough tests of material meeting approved specifications to establish design values on a statistical basis.

\(b\) Material design values must be chosen to minimize the probability of structural failures due to material variability. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, compliance must be shown by selecting material design values which assure material strength with the following probability:

\(1\) Where applied loads are eventually distributed through a single member within an assembly, the failure of which would result in loss of structural integrity of the component, 99 percent probability with 95 percent confidence.

\(2\) For redundant structure, in which the failure of individual elements would result in applied loads being safely distributed to other load carrying members, 90 percent probability with 95 percent confidence.

\(c\) The effects of environmental conditions, such as temperature and moisture, on material design values used in an essential component or structure must be considered where these effects are significant within the airplane operating envelope.

\(d\) \[Reserved\]

\(e\) Greater material design values may be used if a “premium selection” of the material is made in which a specimen of each individual item is tested before use to determine that the actual strength properties of that particular item will equal or exceed those used in design.

\(f\) Other material design values may be used if approved by the Administrator.

\(1\) A casting factor of 1.0 or greater may be used, provided that—

\(i\) It is demonstrated, in the form of process qualification, proof of product, and process monitoring that, for each casting design and part number, the castings produced by each foundry and process combination have coefficients of variation of the material properties that are equivalent to those of wrought alloy products of similar composition. Process monitoring must include testing of coupons cut from the prolongations of each casting (or each set of castings, if produced from a single pour into a single mold in a runner system) and, on a sampling basis, coupons cut from critical areas of production castings. The acceptance criteria for the process monitoring inspections and tests must be established and included in the process specifications to ensure the properties of the production castings are controlled to within levels used in design.

\(ii\) Each casting receives:

\(A\) Inspection of 100 percent of its surface, using visual inspection and liquid penetrant or equivalent inspection methods; and

\(B\) Inspection of structurally significant internal areas and areas where defects are likely to occur, using radiographic or equivalent inspection methods.

\(iii\) One casting undergoes a static test and is shown to meet the strength and deformation requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.305   Strength and deformation.\|§25.305]](a) and (b).

\(ii\) Three castings undergo static tests and are shown to meet:

\(A\) The strength requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.305   Strength and deformation.\|§25.305]](b) at an ultimate load corresponding to a casting factor of 1.25; and

\(B\) The deformation requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.305   Strength and deformation.\|§25.305]](a) at a load of 1.15 times the limit load.

\(3\) A casting factor of 1.50 or greater may be used, provided that—

### §25.629   Aeroelastic stability requirements.

\(a\) *General.* The aeroelastic stability evaluations required under this section include flutter, divergence, control reversal and any undue loss of stability and control as a result of structural deformation. The aeroelastic evaluation must include whirl modes associated with any propeller or rotating device that contributes significant dynamic forces. Compliance with this section must be shown by analyses, wind tunnel tests, ground vibration tests, flight tests, or other means found necessary by the Administrator.

\(b\) *Aeroelastic stability envelopes.* The airplane must be designed to be free from aeroelastic instability for all configurations and design conditions within the aeroelastic stability envelopes as follows:

\(1\) For normal conditions without failures, malfunctions, or adverse conditions, all combinations of altitudes and speeds encompassed by the VD/MD versus altitude envelope enlarged at all points by an increase of 15 percent in equivalent airspeed at both constant Mach number and constant altitude. In addition, a proper margin of stability must exist at all speeds up to VD/MD and, there must be no large and rapid reduction in stability as VD/MD is approached. The enlarged envelope may be limited to Mach 1.0 when MD is less than 1.0 at all design altitudes, and

\(2\) For the conditions described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.629   Aeroelastic stability requirements.\|§25.629]](d) below, for all approved altitudes, any airspeed up to the greater airspeed defined by;

\(i\) The VD/MD envelope determined by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.335   Design airspeeds.\|§25.335]](b); or,

\(ii\) An altitude-airspeed envelope defined by a 15 percent increase in equivalent airspeed above VC at constant altitude, from sea level to the altitude of the intersection of 1.15 VC with the extension of the constant cruise Mach number line, MC, then a linear variation in equivalent airspeed to MC + .05 at the altitude of the lowest VC/MC intersection; then, at higher altitudes, up to the maximum flight altitude, the boundary defined by a .05 Mach increase in MC at constant altitude.

\(c\) *Balance weights.* If concentrated balance weights are used, their effectiveness and strength, including supporting structure, must be substantiated.

\(d\) *Failures, malfunctions, and adverse conditions.* The failures, malfunctions, and adverse conditions which must be considered in showing compliance with this section are:

\(1\) Any critical fuel loading conditions, not shown to be extremely improbable, which may result from mismanagement of fuel.

\(2\) Any single failure in any flutter damper system.

\(3\) For airplanes not approved for operation in icing conditions, the maximum likely ice accumulation expected as a result of an inadvertent encounter.

\(4\) Failure of any single element of the structure supporting any engine, independently mounted propeller shaft, large auxiliary power unit, or large externally mounted aerodynamic body (such as an external fuel tank).

\(5\) For airplanes with engines that have propellers or large rotating devices capable of significant dynamic forces, any single failure of the engine structure that would reduce the rigidity of the rotational axis.

\(6\) The absence of aerodynamic or gyroscopic forces resulting from the most adverse combination of feathered propellers or other rotating devices capable of significant dynamic forces. In addition, the effect of a single feathered propeller or rotating device must be coupled with the failures of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section.

\(7\) Any single propeller or rotating device capable of significant dynamic forces rotating at the highest likely overspeed.

\(8\) Any damage or failure condition, required or selected for investigation by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.571   Damage—tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.\|§25.571]]. The single structural failures described in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section need not be considered in showing compliance with this section if;

\(i\) The structural element could not fail due to discrete source damage resulting from the conditions described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.571   Damage—tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.\|§25.571]](e), and

\(ii\) A damage tolerance investigation in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.571   Damage—tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.\|§25.571]](b) shows that the maximum extent of damage assumed for the purpose of residual strength evaluation does not involve complete failure of the structural element.

\(9\) Any damage, failure, or malfunction considered under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.631   Bird strike damage.\|§§25.631]], 25.671, 25.672, and 25.1309.

\(10\) Any other combination of failures, malfunctions, or adverse conditions not shown to be extremely improbable.

\(e\) *Flight flutter testing.* Full scale flight flutter tests at speeds up to VDF/MDF must be conducted for new type designs and for modifications to a type design unless the modifications have been shown to have an insignificant effect on the aeroelastic stability. These tests must demonstrate that the airplane has a proper margin of damping at all speeds up to VDF/MDF, and that there is no large and rapid reduction in damping as VDF/MDF, is approached. If a failure, malfunction, or adverse condition is simulated during flight test in showing compliance with paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum speed investigated need not exceed VFC/MFC if it is shown, by correlation of the flight test data with other test data or analyses, that the airplane is free from any aeroelastic instability at all speeds within the altitude-airspeed envelope described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

\(b\) Each element of each flight control system must be designed, or distinctively and permanently marked, to minimize the probability of incorrect assembly that could result in the malfunctioning of the system.

\(c\) The airplane must be shown by analysis, tests, or both, to be capable of continued safe flight and landing after any of the following failures or jamming in the flight control system and surfaces (including trim, lift, drag, and feel systems), within the normal flight envelope, without requiring exceptional piloting skill or strength. Probable malfunctions must have only minor effects on control system operation and must be capable of being readily counteracted by the pilot.

\(1\) Any single failure, excluding jamming (for example, disconnection or failure of mechanical elements, or structural failure of hydraulic components, such as actuators, control spool housing, and valves).

\(2\) Any combination of failures not shown to be extremely improbable, excluding jamming (for example, dual electrical or hydraulic system failures, or any single failure in combination with any probable hydraulic or electrical failure).

Pulleys and sprockets must have closely fitted guards to prevent the cables and chains from being displaced or fouled. Each pulley must lie in the plane passing through the cable so that the cable does not rub against the pulley flange.

\(c\) Fairleads must be installed so that they do not cause a change in cable direction of more than three degrees.

\(d\) Clevis pins subject to load or motion and retained only by cotter pins may not be used in the control system.

\(a\) Unless the airplane has safe flight characteristics with the flaps or slats retracted on one side and extended on the other, the motion of flaps or slats on opposite sides of the plane of symmetry must be synchronized by a mechanical interconnection or approved equivalent means.

\(b\) If a wing flap or slat interconnection or equivalent means is used, it must be designed to account for the applicable unsymmetrical loads, including those resulting from flight with the engines on one side of the plane of symmetry inoperative and the remaining engines at takeoff power.

\(c\) For airplanes with flaps or slats that are not subjected to slipstream conditions, the structure must be designed for the loads imposed when the wing flaps or slats on one side are carrying the most severe load occurring in the prescribed symmetrical conditions and those on the other side are carrying not more than 80 percent of that load.

### Landing Gear

### §25.721   General.

\(a\) The landing gear system must be designed so that when it fails due to overloads during takeoff and landing, the failure mode is not likely to cause spillage of enough fuel to constitute a fire hazard. The overloads must be assumed to act in the upward and aft directions in combination with side loads acting inboard and outboard. In the absence of a more rational analysis, the side loads must be assumed to be up to 20 percent of the vertical load or 20 percent of the drag load, whichever is greater.

\(b\) The airplane must be designed to avoid any rupture leading to the spillage of enough fuel to constitute a fire hazard as a result of a wheels-up landing on a paved runway, under the following minor crash landing conditions:

\(1\) Impact at 5 feet-per-second vertical velocity, with the airplane under control, at Maximum Design Landing Weight—

\(i\) With the landing gear fully retracted; and

\(ii\) With any one or more landing gear legs not extended.

\(2\) Sliding on the ground, with—

\(i\) The landing gear fully retracted and with up to a 20° yaw angle; and

\(ii\) Any one or more landing gear legs not extended and with 0° yaw angle.

\(c\) For configurations where the engine nacelle is likely to come into contact with the ground, the engine pylon or engine mounting must be designed so that when it fails due to overloads (assuming the overloads to act predominantly in the upward direction and separately, predominantly in the aft direction), the failure mode is not likely to cause the spillage of enough fuel to constitute a fire hazard.

\[Amdt. 25-139, 79 FR 59430, Oct. 2, 2014\]

### §25.723   Shock absorption tests.

\(a\) The analytical representation of the landing gear dynamic characteristics that is used in determining the landing loads must be validated by energy absorption tests. A range of tests must be conducted to ensure that the analytical representation is valid for the design conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.473   Landing load conditions and assumptions.\|§25.473]].

\(1\) The configurations subjected to energy absorption tests at limit design conditions must include at least the design landing weight or the design takeoff weight, whichever produces the greater value of landing impact energy.

\(2\) The test attitude of the landing gear unit and the application of appropriate drag loads during the test must simulate the airplane landing conditions in a manner consistent with the development of rational or conservative limit loads.

\(b\) The landing gear may not fail in a test, demonstrating its reserve energy absorption capacity, simulating a descent velocity of 12 f.p.s. at design landing weight, assuming airplane lift not greater than airplane weight acting during the landing impact.

\(c\) In lieu of the tests prescribed in this section, changes in previously approved design weights and minor changes in design may be substantiated by analyses based on previous tests conducted on the same basic landing gear system that has similar energy absorption characteristics.

The switches may be located where they are operated by the actual landing gear locking latch or device.

\(2\) The flightcrew must be given an aural warning that functions continuously, or is periodically repeated, if a landing is attempted when the landing gear is not locked down.

\(c\) Unless it can be shown by analysis or tests that the probability of occurrence of a critical windshield fragmentation condition is of a low order, the airplane must have a means to minimize the danger to the pilots from flying windshield fragments due to bird impact. This must be shown for each transparent pane in the cockpit that—

\(1\) Appears in the front view of the airplane;

\(2\) Is inclined 15 degrees or more to the longitudinal axis of the airplane; and

\(3\) Has any part of the pane located where its fragmentation will constitute a hazard to the pilots.

\(d\) The design of windshields and windows in pressurized airplanes must be based on factors peculiar to high altitude operation, including the effects of continuous and cyclic pressurization loadings, the inherent characteristics of the material used, and the effects of temperatures and temperature differentials. The windshield and window panels must be capable of withstanding the maximum cabin pressure differential loads combined with critical aerodynamic pressure and temperature effects after any single failure in the installation or associated systems. It may be assumed that, after a single failure that is obvious to the flight crew (established under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1523   Minimum flight crew.\|§25.1523]]), the cabin pressure differential is reduced from the maximum, in accordance with appropriate operating limitations, to allow continued safe flight of the airplane with a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 15,000 feet.

\(e\) The windshield panels in front of the pilots must be arranged so that, assuming the loss of vision through any one panel, one or more panels remain available for use by a pilot seated at a pilot station to permit continued safe flight and landing.

### §25.783   Fuselage doors.

\(a\) *General.* This section applies to fuselage doors, which includes all doors, hatches, openable windows, access panels, covers, etc., on the exterior of the fuselage that do not require the use of tools to open or close. This also applies to each door or hatch through a pressure bulkhead, including any bulkhead that is specifically designed to function as a secondary bulkhead under the prescribed failure conditions of part 25. These doors must meet the requirements of this section, taking into account both pressurized and unpressurized flight, and must be designed as follows:

\(1\) Each door must have means to safeguard against opening in flight as a result of mechanical failure, or failure of any single structural element.

\(2\) Each door that could be a hazard if it unlatches must be designed so that unlatching during pressurized and unpressurized flight from the fully closed, latched, and locked condition is extremely improbable. This must be shown by safety analysis.

\(3\) Each element of each door operating system must be designed or, where impracticable, distinctively and permanently marked, to minimize the probability of incorrect assembly and adjustment that could result in a malfunction.

\(4\) All sources of power that could initiate unlocking or unlatching of any door must be automatically isolated from the latching and locking systems prior to flight and it must not be possible to restore power to the door during flight.

\(5\) Each removable bolt, screw, nut, pin, or other removable fastener must meet the locking requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.607   Fasteners.\|§25.607]].

\(6\) Certain doors, as specified by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.807   Emergency exits.\|§25.807]](h), must also meet the applicable requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.809   Emergency exit arrangement.\|§§25.809]] through 25.812 for emergency exits.

\(b\) *Opening by persons.* There must be a means to safeguard each door against opening during flight due to inadvertent action by persons. In addition, design precautions must be taken to minimize the possibility for a person to open a door intentionally during flight. If these precautions include the use of auxiliary devices, those devices and their controlling systems must be designed so that—

\(1\) No single failure will prevent more than one exit from being opened; and

\(2\) Failures that would prevent opening of the exit after landing are improbable.

\(c\) *Pressurization prevention means.* There must be a provision to prevent pressurization of the airplane to an unsafe level if any door subject to pressurization is not fully closed, latched, and locked.

\(1\) The provision must be designed to function after any single failure, or after any combination of failures not shown to be extremely improbable.

\(2\) Doors that meet the conditions described in paragraph (h) of this section are not required to have a dedicated pressurization prevention means if, from every possible position of the door, it will remain open to the extent that it prevents pressurization or safely close and latch as pressurization takes place. This must also be shown with any single failure and malfunction, except that—

\(i\) With failures or malfunctions in the latching mechanism, it need not latch after closing; and

\(ii\) With jamming as a result of mechanical failure or blocking debris, the door need not close and latch if it can be shown that the pressurization loads on the jammed door or mechanism would not result in an unsafe condition.

\(d\) *Latching and locking.* The latching and locking mechanisms must be designed as follows:

\(1\) There must be a provision to latch each door.

\(2\) The latches and their operating mechanism must be designed so that, under all airplane flight and ground loading conditions, with the door latched, there is no force or torque tending to unlatch the latches. In addition, the latching system must include a means to secure the latches in the latched position. This means must be independent of the locking system.

\(3\) Each door subject to pressurization, and for which the initial opening movement is not inward, must—

\(i\) Have an individual lock for each latch;

\(ii\) Have the lock located as close as practicable to the latch; and

\(iii\) Be designed so that, during pressurized flight, no single failure in the locking system would prevent the locks from restraining the latches necessary to secure the door.

\(4\) Each door for which the initial opening movement is inward, and unlatching of the door could result in a hazard, must have a locking means to prevent the latches from becoming disengaged. The locking means must ensure sufficient latching to prevent opening of the door even with a single failure of the latching mechanism.

\(5\) It must not be possible to position the lock in the locked position if the latch and the latching mechanism are not in the latched position.

\(6\) It must not be possible to unlatch the latches with the locks in the locked position. Locks must be designed to withstand the limit loads resulting from—

\(i\) The maximum operator effort when the latches are operated manually;

\(ii\) The powered latch actuators, if installed; and

\(iii\) The relative motion between the latch and the structural counterpart.

\(7\) Each door for which unlatching would not result in a hazard is not required to have a locking mechanism meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(6) of this section.

\(e\) *Warning, caution, and advisory indications.* Doors must be provided with the following indications:

\(1\) There must be a positive means to indicate at each door operator's station that all required operations to close, latch, and lock the door(s) have been completed.

\(2\) There must be a positive means clearly visible from each operator station for any door that could be a hazard if unlatched to indicate if the door is not fully closed, latched, and locked.

\(3\) There must be a visual means on the flight deck to signal the pilots if any door is not fully closed, latched, and locked. The means must be designed such that any failure or combination of failures that would result in an erroneous closed, latched, and locked indication is improbable for—

\(i\) Each door that is subject to pressurization and for which the initial opening movement is not inward; or

\(ii\) Each door that could be a hazard if unlatched.

\(4\) There must be an aural warning to the pilots prior to or during the initial portion of takeoff roll if any door is not fully closed, latched, and locked, and its opening would prevent a safe takeoff and return to landing.

\(f\) *Visual inspection provision.* Each door for which unlatching of the door could be a hazard must have a provision for direct visual inspection to determine, without ambiguity, if the door is fully closed, latched, and locked. The provision must be permanent and discernible under operational lighting conditions, or by means of a flashlight or equivalent light source.

\(g\) *Certain maintenance doors, removable emergency exits, and access panels.* Some doors not normally opened except for maintenance purposes or emergency evacuation and some access panels need not comply with certain paragraphs of this section as follows:

\(1\) Access panels that are not subject to cabin pressurization and would not be a hazard if open during flight need not comply with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but must have a means to prevent inadvertent opening during flight.

\(2\) Inward-opening removable emergency exits that are not normally removed, except for maintenance purposes or emergency evacuation, and flight deck-openable windows need not comply with paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section.

\(3\) Maintenance doors that meet the conditions of paragraph (h) of this section, and for which a placard is provided limiting use to maintenance access, need not comply with paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section.

\(h\) *Doors that are not a hazard.* For the purposes of this section, a door is considered not to be a hazard in the unlatched condition during flight, provided it can be shown to meet all of the following conditions:

\(1\) Doors in pressurized compartments would remain in the fully closed position if not restrained by the latches when subject to a pressure greater than 1⁄2 psi. Opening by persons, either inadvertently or intentionally, need not be considered in making this determination.

\(2\) The door would remain inside the airplane or remain attached to the airplane if it opens either in pressurized or unpressurized portions of the flight. This determination must include the consideration of inadvertent and intentional opening by persons during either pressurized or unpressurized portions of the flight.

\(3\) The disengagement of the latches during flight would not allow depressurization of the cabin to an unsafe level. This safety assessment must include the physiological effects on the occupants.

\(4\) The open door during flight would not create aerodynamic interference that could preclude safe flight and landing.

\(5\) The airplane would meet the structural design requirements with the door open. This assessment must include the aeroelastic stability requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.629   Aeroelastic stability requirements.\|§25.629]], as well as the strength requirements of subpart C of this part.

\(6\) The unlatching or opening of the door must not preclude safe flight and landing as a result of interaction with other systems or structures.

\[Doc. No. 2003-14193, 69 FR 24501, May 3, 2004\]

### §25.785   Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses.

\(a\) A seat (or berth for a nonambulant person) must be provided for each occupant who has reached his or her second birthday.

\(b\) Each seat, berth, safety belt, harness, and adjacent part of the airplane at each station designated as occupiable during takeoff and landing must be designed so that a person making proper use of these facilities will not suffer serious injury in an emergency landing as a result of the inertia forces specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§§25.561]] and 25.562.

\(c\) Each seat or berth must be approved.

\(d\) Each occupant of a seat that makes more than an 18-degree angle with the vertical plane containing the airplane centerline must be protected from head injury by a safety belt and an energy absorbing rest that will support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine, or by a safety belt and shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious object. Each occupant of any other seat must be protected from head injury by a safety belt and, as appropriate to the type, location, and angle of facing of each seat, by one or more of the following:

\(1\) A shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious object.

\(2\) The elimination of any injurious object within striking radius of the head.

\(3\) An energy absorbing rest that will support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine.

\(e\) Each berth must be designed so that the forward part has a padded end board, canvas diaphragm, or equivalent means, that can withstand the static load reaction of the occupant when subjected to the forward inertia force specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]]. Berths must be free from corners and protuberances likely to cause injury to a person occupying the berth during emergency conditions.

\(f\) Each seat or berth, and its supporting structure, and each safety belt or harness and its anchorage must be designed for an occupant weight of 170 pounds, considering the maximum load factors, inertia forces, and reactions among the occupant, seat, safety belt, and harness for each relevant flight and ground load condition (including the emergency landing conditions prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]]). In addition—

\(1\) The structural analysis and testing of the seats, berths, and their supporting structures may be determined by assuming that the critical load in the forward, sideward, downward, upward, and rearward directions (as determined from the prescribed flight, ground, and emergency landing conditions) acts separately or using selected combinations of loads if the required strength in each specified direction is substantiated. The forward load factor need not be applied to safety belts for berths.

\(2\) Each pilot seat must be designed for the reactions resulting from the application of the pilot forces prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.395   Control system.\|§25.395]].

\(3\) The inertia forces specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]] must be multiplied by a factor of 1.33 (instead of the fitting factor prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.625   Fitting factors.\|§25.625]]) in determining the strength of the attachment of each seat to the structure and each belt or harness to the seat or structure.

\(g\) Each seat at a flight deck station must have a restraint system consisting of a combined safety belt and shoulder harness with a single-point release that permits the flight deck occupant, when seated with the restraint system fastened, to perform all of the occupant's necessary flight deck functions. There must be a means to secure each combined restraint system when not in use to prevent interference with the operation of the airplane and with rapid egress in an emergency.

\(h\) Each seat located in the passenger compartment and designated for use during takeoff and landing by a flight attendant required by the operating rules of this chapter must be:

\(1\) Near a required floor level emergency exit, except that another location is acceptable if the emergency egress of passengers would be enhanced with that location. A flight attendant seat must be located adjacent to each Type A or B emergency exit. Other flight attendant seats must be evenly distributed among the required floor- level emergency exits to the extent feasible.

\(2\) To the extent possible, without compromising proximity to a required floor level emergency exit, located to provide a direct view of the cabin area for which the flight attendant is responsible.

\(3\) Positioned so that the seat will not interfere with the use of a passageway or exit when the seat is not in use.

\(4\) Located to minimize the probability that occupants would suffer injury by being struck by items dislodged from service areas, stowage compartments, or service equipment.

\(5\) Either forward or rearward facing with an energy absorbing rest that is designed to support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine.

\(6\) Equipped with a restraint system consisting of a combined safety belt and shoulder harness unit with a single point release. There must be means to secure each restraint system when not in use to prevent interference with rapid egress in an emergency.

\(i\) Each safety belt must be equipped with a metal to metal latching device.

\(j\) If the seat backs do not provide a firm handhold, there must be a handgrip or rail along each aisle to enable persons to steady themselves while using the aisles in moderately rough air.

\(k\) Each projecting object that would injure persons seated or moving about the airplane in normal flight must be padded.

\(l\) Each forward observer's seat required by the operating rules must be shown to be suitable for use in conducting the necessary enroute inspection.

### §25.787   Stowage compartments.

\(a\) Each compartment for the stowage of cargo, baggage, carry-on articles, and equipment (such as life rafts), and any other stowage compartment, must be designed for its placarded maximum weight of contents and for the critical load distribution at the appropriate maximum load factors corresponding to the specified flight and ground load conditions, and to those emergency landing conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]](b)(3) for which the breaking loose of the contents of such compartments in the specified direction could—

\(1\) Cause direct injury to occupants;

\(2\) Penetrate fuel tanks or lines or cause fire or explosion hazard by damage to adjacent systems; or

\(3\) Nullify any of the escape facilities provided for use after an emergency landing.

\(b\) There must be a means to prevent the contents in the compartments from becoming a hazard by shifting, under the loads specified in paragraph (a) of this section. For stowage compartments in the passenger and crew cabin, if the means used is a latched door, the design must take into consideration the wear and deterioration expected in service.

\(c\) If cargo compartment lamps are installed, each lamp must be installed so as to prevent contact between lamp bulb and cargo.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-32, 37 FR 3969, Feb. 24, 1972; Amdt. 25-38, 41 FR 55466, Dec. 20, 1976; Amdt. 25-51, 45 FR 7755, Feb. 4, 1980; Amdt. 25-139, 79 FR 59430, Oct. 2, 2014\]

### §25.789   Retention of items of mass in passenger and crew compartments and galleys.

\(a\) Means must be provided to prevent each item of mass (that is part of the airplane type design) in a passenger or crew compartment or galley from becoming a hazard by shifting under the appropriate maximum load factors corresponding to the specified flight and ground load conditions, and to the emergency landing conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]](b).

\(b\) Each interphone restraint system must be designed so that when subjected to the load factors specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]](b)(3), the interphone will remain in its stowed position.

### §25.791   Passenger information signs and placards.

\(a\) If smoking is to be prohibited, there must be at least one placard so stating that is legible to each person seated in the cabin. If smoking is to be allowed, and if the crew compartment is separated from the passenger compartment, there must be at least one sign notifying when smoking is prohibited. Signs which notify when smoking is prohibited must be operable by a member of the flightcrew and, when illuminated, must be legible under all probable conditions of cabin illumination to each person seated in the cabin.

\(b\) Signs that notify when seat belts should be fastened and that are installed to comply with the operating rules of this chapter must be operable by a member of the flightcrew and, when illuminated, must be legible under all probable conditions of cabin illumination to each person seated in the cabin.

\(c\) A placard must be located on or adjacent to the door of each receptacle used for the disposal of flammable waste materials to indicate that use of the receptacle for disposal of cigarettes, etc., is prohibited.

\(d\) Lavatories must have “No Smoking” or “No Smoking in Lavatory” placards conspicuously located on or adjacent to each side of the entry door.

\(e\) Symbols that clearly express the intent of the sign or placard may be used in lieu of letters.

\[Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29780, July 20, 1990\]

### §25.793   Floor surfaces.

The floor surface of all areas which are likely to become wet in service must have slip resistant properties.

\[Amdt. 25-51, 45 FR 7755, Feb. 4, 1980\]

### §25.795   Security considerations.

\(a\) *Protection of flightcrew compartment.* If a flightdeck door is required by operating rules:

\(1\) The bulkhead, door, and any other accessible boundary separating the flightcrew compartment from occupied areas must be designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons and be capable of withstanding impacts of 300 joules (221.3 foot pounds).

\(2\) The bulkhead, door, and any other accessible boundary separating the flightcrew compartment from occupied areas must be designed to resist a constant 250 pound (1,113 Newtons) tensile load on accessible handholds, including the doorknob or handle.

\(3\) The bulkhead, door, and any other boundary separating the flightcrew compartment from any occupied areas must be designed to resist penetration by small arms fire and fragmentation devices to a level equivalent to level IIIa of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Standard 0101.04.

\(b\) Airplanes with a maximum certificated passenger seating capacity of more than 60 persons or a maximum certificated takeoff gross weight of over 100,000 pounds (45,359 Kilograms) must be designed to limit the effects of an explosive or incendiary device as follows:

\(1\) *Flightdeck smoke protection.* Means must be provided to limit entry of smoke, fumes, and noxious gases into the flightdeck.

\(2\) *Passenger cabin smoke protection.* Means must be provided to prevent passenger incapacitation in the cabin resulting from smoke, fumes, and noxious gases as represented by the initial combined volumetric concentrations of 0.59% carbon monoxide and 1.23% carbon dioxide.

\(3\) *Cargo compartment fire suppression.* An extinguishing agent must be capable of suppressing a fire. All cargo-compartment fire suppression systems must be designed to withstand the following effects, including support structure displacements or adjacent materials displacing against the distribution system:

\(i\) Impact or damage from a 0.5-inch diameter aluminum sphere traveling at 430 feet per second (131.1 meters per second);

\(ii\) A 15-pound per square-inch (103.4 kPa) pressure load if the projected surface area of the component is greater than 4 square feet. Any single dimension greater than 4 feet (1.22 meters) may be assumed to be 4 feet (1.22 meters) in length; and

\(iii\) A 6-inch (0.152 meters) displacement, except where limited by the fuselage contour, from a single point force applied anywhere along the distribution system where relative movement between the system and its attachment can occur.

\(iv\) Paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section do not apply to components that are redundant and separated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or are installed remotely from the cargo compartment.

\(c\) An airplane with a maximum certificated passenger seating capacity of more than 60 persons or a maximum certificated takeoff gross weight of over 100,000 pounds (45,359 Kilograms) must comply with the following:

\(1\) *Least risk bomb location.* An airplane must be designed with a designated location where a bomb or other explosive device could be placed to best protect flight-critical structures and systems from damage in the case of detonation.

\(2\) *Survivability of systems.* (i) Except where impracticable, redundant airplane systems necessary for continued safe flight and landing must be physically separated, at a minimum, by an amount equal to a sphere of diameter

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er28oc08.003.pdf)

\(ii\) Where compliance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is impracticable, other design precautions must be taken to maximize the survivability of those systems.

\(3\) *Interior design to facilitate searches.* Design features must be incorporated that will deter concealment or promote discovery of weapons, explosives, or other objects from a simple inspection in the following areas of the airplane cabin:

\(i\) Areas above the overhead bins must be designed to prevent objects from being hidden from view in a simple search from the aisle. Designs that prevent concealment of objects with volumes 20 cubic inches and greater satisfy this requirement.

\(ii\) Toilets must be designed to prevent the passage of solid objects greater than 2.0 inches in diameter.

\(iii\) Life preservers or their storage locations must be designed so that tampering is evident.

\(d\) Each chemical oxygen generator or its installation must be designed to be secure from deliberate manipulation by one of the following:

\(1\) By providing effective resistance to tampering,

\(2\) By providing an effective combination of resistance to tampering and active tamper-evident features,

\(3\) By installation in a location or manner whereby any attempt to access the generator would be immediately obvious, or

\(4\) By a combination of approaches specified in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section that the Administrator finds provides a secure installation.

\(e\) *Exceptions.* Airplanes used solely to transport cargo only need to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (c)(2) of this section.

\(f\) *Material Incorporated by Reference.* You must use National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Standard 0101.04, Ballistic Resistance of Personal Body Armor, June 2001, Revision A, to establish ballistic resistance as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

### Emergency Provisions

### §25.801   Ditching.

\(a\) If certification with ditching provisions is requested, the airplane must meet the requirements of this section and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.807   Emergency exits.\|§§25.807]](e), 25.1411, and 25.1415(a).

\(b\) Each practicable design measure, compatible with the general characteristics of the airplane, must be taken to minimize the probability that in an emergency landing on water, the behavior of the airplane would cause immediate injury to the occupants or would make it impossible for them to escape.

\(c\) The probable behavior of the airplane in a water landing must be investigated by model tests or by comparison with airplanes of similar configuration for which the ditching characteristics are known. Scoops, flaps, projections, and any other factor likely to affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the airplane, must be considered.

\(d\) It must be shown that, under reasonably probable water conditions, the flotation time and trim of the airplane will allow the occupants to leave the airplane and enter the liferafts required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1415   Ditching equipment.\|§25.1415]]. If compliance with this provision is shown by buoyancy and trim computations, appropriate allowances must be made for probable structural damage and leakage. If the airplane has fuel tanks (with fuel jettisoning provisions) that can reasonably be expected to withstand a ditching without leakage, the jettisonable volume of fuel may be considered as buoyancy volume.

\(e\) Unless the effects of the collapse of external doors and windows are accounted for in the investigation of the probable behavior of the airplane in a water landing (as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), the external doors and windows must be designed to withstand the probable maximum local pressures.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29781, July 20, 1990\]

### §25.803   Emergency evacuation.

\(a\) Each crew and passenger area must have emergency means to allow rapid evacuation in crash landings, with the landing gear extended as well as with the landing gear retracted, considering the possibility of the airplane being on fire.

### §25.807   Emergency exits.

\(a\) *Type.* For the purpose of this part, the types of exits are defined as follows:

\(1\) *Type I.* This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of not less than 24 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner radii not greater than eight inches.

\(2\) *Type II.* This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 20 inches wide by 44 inches high, with corner radii not greater than seven inches. Type II exits must be floor-level exits unless located over the wing, in which case they must not have a step-up inside the airplane of more than 10 inches nor a step-down outside the airplane of more than 17 inches.

\(3\) *Type III.* This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 20 inches wide by 36 inches high with corner radii not greater than seven inches, and with a step-up inside the airplane of not more than 20 inches. If the exit is located over the wing, the step-down outside the airplane may not exceed 27 inches.

\(4\) *Type IV.* This type is a rectangular opening of not less than 19 inches wide by 26 inches high, with corner radii not greater than 6.3 inches, located over the wing, with a step-up inside the airplane of not more than 29 inches and a step-down outside the airplane of not more than 36 inches.

\(5\) *Ventral.* This type is an exit from the passenger compartment through the pressure shell and the bottom fuselage skin. The dimensions and physical configuration of this type of exit must allow at least the same rate of egress as a Type I exit with the airplane in the normal ground attitude, with landing gear extended.

\(6\) *Tailcone.* This type is an aft exit from the passenger compartment through the pressure shell and through an openable cone of the fuselage aft of the pressure shell. The means of opening the tailcone must be simple and obvious and must employ a single operation.

\(7\) *Type A.* This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of not less than 42 inches wide by 72 inches high, with corner radii not greater than seven inches.

\(8\) *Type B.* This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of not less than 32 inches wide by 72 inches high, with corner radii not greater than six inches.

\(9\) *Type C.* This type is a floor-level exit with a rectangular opening of not less than 30 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner radii not greater than 10 inches.

\(b\) *Step down distance.* Step down distance, as used in this section, means the actual distance between the bottom of the required opening and a usable foot hold, extending out from the fuselage, that is large enough to be effective without searching by sight or feel.

\(c\) *Over-sized exits.* Openings larger than those specified in this section, whether or not of rectangular shape, may be used if the specified rectangular opening can be inscribed within the opening and the base of the inscribed rectangular opening meets the specified step-up and step-down heights.

\(d\) *Asymmetry.* Exits of an exit pair need not be diametrically opposite each other nor of the same size; however, the number of passenger seats permitted under paragraph (g) of this section is based on the smaller of the two exits.

\(e\) *Uniformity.* Exits must be distributed as uniformly as practical, taking into account passenger seat distribution.

\(f\) *Location.* (1) Each required passenger emergency exit must be accessible to the passengers and located where it will afford the most effective means of passenger evacuation.

\(2\) If only one floor-level exit per side is prescribed, and the airplane does not have a tailcone or ventral emergency exit, the floor-level exits must be in the rearward part of the passenger compartment unless another location affords a more effective means of passenger evacuation.

\(3\) If more than one floor-level exit per side is prescribed, and the airplane does not have a combination cargo and passenger configuration, at least one floor-level exit must be located in each side near each end of the cabin.

\(4\) For an airplane that is required to have more than one passenger emergency exit for each side of the fuselage, no passenger emergency exit shall be more than 60 feet from any adjacent passenger emergency exit on the same side of the same deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges.

\(g\) *Type and number required.* The maximum number of passenger seats permitted depends on the type and number of exits installed in each side of the fuselage. Except as further restricted in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(9) of this section, the maximum number of passenger seats permitted for each exit of a specific type installed in each side of the fuselage is as follows:

<div>

<div>

</div>

</div>

\(1\) For a passenger seating configuration of 1 to 9 seats, there must be at least one Type IV or larger overwing exit in each side of the fuselage or, if overwing exits are not provided, at least one exit in each side that meets the minimum dimensions of a Type III exit.

\(2\) For a passenger seating configuration of more than 9 seats, each exit must be a Type III or larger exit.

\(3\) For a passenger seating configuration of 10 to 19 seats, there must be at least one Type III or larger exit in each side of the fuselage.

\(4\) For a passenger seating configuration of 20 to 40 seats, there must be at least two exits, one of which must be a Type II or larger exit, in each side of the fuselage.

\(5\) For a passenger seating configuration of 41 to 110 seats, there must be at least two exits, one of which must be a Type I or larger exit, in each side of the fuselage.

\(6\) For a passenger seating configuration of more than 110 seats, the emergency exits in each side of the fuselage must include at least two Type I or larger exits.

\(7\) The combined maximum number of passenger seats permitted for all Type III exits is 70, and the combined maximum number of passenger seats permitted for two Type III exits in each side of the fuselage that are separated by fewer than three passenger seat rows is 65.

\(8\) If a Type A, Type B, or Type C exit is installed, there must be at least two Type C or larger exits in each side of the fuselage.

\(9\) If a passenger ventral or tailcone exit is installed and that exit provides at least the same rate of egress as a Type III exit with the airplane in the most adverse exit opening condition that would result from the collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear, an increase in the passenger seating configuration is permitted as follows:

\(i\) For a ventral exit, 12 additional passenger seats.

\(ii\) For a tailcone exit incorporating a floor level opening of not less than 20 inches wide by 60 inches high, with corner radii not greater than seven inches, in the pressure shell and incorporating an approved assist means in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.810   Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.\|§25.810]](a), 25 additional passenger seats.

\(iii\) For a tailcone exit incorporating an opening in the pressure shell which is at least equivalent to a Type III emergency exit with respect to dimensions, step-up and step-down distance, and with the top of the opening not less than 56 inches from the passenger compartment floor, 15 additional passenger seats.

\(h\) *Other exits.* The following exits also must meet the applicable emergency exit requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.809   Emergency exit arrangement.\|§§25.809]] through 25.812, and must be readily accessible:

\(1\) Each emergency exit in the passenger compartment in excess of the minimum number of required emergency exits.

\(2\) Any other floor-level door or exit that is accessible from the passenger compartment and is as large or larger than a Type II exit, but less than 46 inches wide.

\(3\) Any other ventral or tail cone passenger exit.

\(i\) *Ditching emergency exits for passengers.* Whether or not ditching certification is requested, ditching emergency exits must be provided in accordance with the following requirements, unless the emergency exits required by paragraph (g) of this section already meet them:

\(1\) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of nine or fewer seats, excluding pilot seats, one exit above the waterline in each side of the airplane, meeting at least the dimensions of a Type IV exit.

\(2\) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 10 of more seats, excluding pilot seats, one exit above the waterline in a side of the airplane, meeting at least the dimensions of a Type III exit for each unit (or part of a unit) of 35 passenger seats, but no less than two such exits in the passenger cabin, with one on each side of the airplane. The passenger seat/ exit ratio may be increased through the use of larger exits, or other means, provided it is shown that the evacuation capability during ditching has been improved accordingly.

\(3\) If it is impractical to locate side exits above the waterline, the side exits must be replaced by an equal number of readily accessible overhead hatches of not less than the dimensions of a Type III exit, except that for airplanes with a passenger configuration of 35 or fewer seats, excluding pilot seats, the two required Type III side exits need be replaced by only one overhead hatch.

\(j\) *Flightcrew emergency exits.* For airplanes in which the proximity of passenger emergency exits to the flightcrew area does not offer a convenient and readily accessible means of evacuation of the flightcrew, and for all airplanes having a passenger seating capacity greater than 20, flightcrew exits shall be located in the flightcrew area. Such exits shall be of sufficient size and so located as to permit rapid evacuation by the crew. One exit shall be provided on each side of the airplane; or, alternatively, a top hatch shall be provided. Each exit must encompass an unobstructed rectangular opening of at least 19 by 20 inches unless satisfactory exit utility can be demonstrated by a typical crewmember.

\[Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29781, July 20, 1990, as amended by Amdt. 25-88, 61 FR 57956, Nov. 8, 1996; 62 FR 1817, Jan. 13, 1997; Amdt. 25-94, 63 FR 8848, Feb. 23, 1998; 63 FR 12862, Mar. 16, 1998; Amdt. 25-114, 69 FR 24502, May 3, 2004\]

### §25.809   Emergency exit arrangement.

\(a\) Each emergency exit, including each flightcrew emergency exit, must be a moveable door or hatch in the external walls of the fuselage, allowing an unobstructed opening to the outside. In addition, each emergency exit must have means to permit viewing of the conditions outside the exit when the exit is closed. The viewing means may be on or adjacent to the exit provided no obstructions exist between the exit and the viewing means. Means must also be provided to permit viewing of the likely areas of evacuee ground contact. The likely areas of evacuee ground contact must be viewable during all lighting conditions with the landing gear extended as well as in all conditions of landing gear collapse.

\(b\) Each emergency exit must be openable from the inside and the outside except that sliding window emergency exits in the flight crew area need not be openable from the outside if other approved exits are convenient and readily accessible to the flight crew area. Each emergency exit must be capable of being opened, when there is no fuselage deformation—

\(1\) With the airplane in the normal ground attitude and in each of the attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear; and

\(2\) Within 10 seconds measured from the time when the opening means is actuated to the time when the exit is fully opened.

\(3\) Even though persons may be crowded against the door on the inside of the airplane.

\(c\) The means of opening emergency exits must be simple and obvious; may not require exceptional effort; and must be arranged and marked so that it can be readily located and operated, even in darkness. Internal exit-opening means involving sequence operations (such as operation of two handles or latches, or the release of safety catches) may be used for flightcrew emergency exits if it can be reasonably established that these means are simple and obvious to crewmembers trained in their use.

\(d\) If a single power-boost or single power-operated system is the primary system for operating more than one exit in an emergency, each exit must be capable of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section in the event of failure of the primary system. Manual operation of the exit (after failure of the primary system) is acceptable.

\(e\) Each emergency exit must be shown by tests, or by a combination of analysis and tests, to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

\(f\) Each door must be located where persons using them will not be endangered by the propellers when appropriate operating procedures are used.

\(g\) There must be provisions to minimize the probability of jamming of the emergency exits resulting from fuselage deformation in a minor crash landing.

\(h\) When required by the operating rules for any large passenger-carrying turbojet-powered airplane, each ventral exit and tailcone exit must be—

\(1\) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight; and

\(2\) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit, stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight.

\(i\) Each emergency exit must have a means to retain the exit in the open position, once the exit is opened in an emergency. The means must not require separate action to engage when the exit is opened, and must require positive action to disengage.

No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-15, 32 FR 13264, Sept. 20, 1967; Amdt. 25-32, 37 FR 3970, Feb. 24, 1972; Amdt. 25-34, 37 FR 25355, Nov. 30, 1972; Amdt. 25-46, 43 FR 50597, Oct. 30, 1978; Amdt. 25-47, 44 FR 61325, Oct. 25, 1979; Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29782, July 20, 1990; Amdt. 25-114, 69 FR 24502, May 3, 2004; Amdt. 25-116, 69 FR 62788, Oct. 27, 2004\]

### §25.810   Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.

\(a\) Each non over-wing Type A, Type B or Type C exit, and any other non over-wing landplane emergency exit more than 6 feet from the ground with the airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, must have an approved means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground.

\(1\) The assisting means for each passenger emergency exit must be a self-supporting slide or equivalent; and, in the case of Type A or Type B exits, it must be capable of carrying simultaneously two parallel lines of evacuees. In addition, the assisting means must be designed to meet the following requirements—

\(i\) It must be automatically deployed and deployment must begin during the interval between the time the exit opening means is actuated from inside the airplane and the time the exit is fully opened. However, each passenger emergency exit which is also a passenger entrance door or a service door must be provided with means to prevent deployment of the assisting means when it is opened from either the inside or the outside under nonemergency conditions for normal use.

\(ii\) Except for assisting means installed at Type C exits, it must be automatically erected within 6 seconds after deployment is begun. Assisting means installed at Type C exits must be automatically erected within 10 seconds from the time the opening means of the exit is actuated.

\(iii\) It must be of such length after full deployment that the lower end is self-supporting on the ground and provides safe evacuation of occupants to the ground after collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear.

\(iv\) It must have the capability, in 25-knot winds directed from the most critical angle, to deploy and, with the assistance of only one person, to remain usable after full deployment to evacuate occupants safely to the ground.

\(v\) For each system installation (mockup or airplane installed), five consecutive deployment and inflation tests must be conducted (per exit) without failure, and at least three tests of each such five-test series must be conducted using a single representative sample of the device. The sample devices must be deployed and inflated by the system's primary means after being subjected to the inertia forces specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]](b). If any part of the system fails or does not function properly during the required tests, the cause of the failure or malfunction must be corrected by positive means and after that, the full series of five consecutive deployment and inflation tests must be conducted without failure.

\(2\) The assisting means for flightcrew emergency exits may be a rope or any other means demonstrated to be suitable for the purpose. If the assisting means is a rope, or an approved device equivalent to a rope, it must be—

\(i\) Attached to the fuselage structure at or above the top of the emergency exit opening, or, for a device at a pilot's emergency exit window, at another approved location if the stowed device, or its attachment, would reduce the pilot's view in flight;

\(ii\) Able (with its attachment) to withstand a 400-pound static load.

\(b\) Assist means from the cabin to the wing are required for each type A or Type B exit located above the wing and having a stepdown unless the exit without an assist-means can be shown to have a rate of passenger egress at least equal to that of the same type of non over-wing exit. If an assist means is required, it must be automatically deployed and automatically erected concurrent with the opening of the exit. In the case of assist means installed at Type C exits, it must be self-supporting within 10 seconds from the time the opening means of the exits is actuated. For all other exit types, it must be self-supporting 6 seconds after deployment is begun.

\(c\) An escape route must be established from each overwing emergency exit, and (except for flap surfaces suitable as slides) covered with a slip resistant surface. Except where a means for channeling the flow of evacuees is provided—

\(1\) The escape route from each Type A or Type B passenger emergency exit, or any common escape route from two Type III passenger emergency exits, must be at least 42 inches wide; that from any other passenger emergency exit must be at least 24 inches wide; and

\(2\) The escape route surface must have a reflectance of at least 80 percent, and must be defined by markings with a surface-to-marking contrast ratio of at least 5:1.

\(d\) Means must be provided to assist evacuees to reach the ground for all Type C exits located over the wing and, if the place on the airplane structure at which the escape route required in paragraph (c) of this section terminates is more than 6 feet from the ground with the airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, for all other exit types.

\(1\) If the escape route is over the flap, the height of the terminal edge must be measured with the flap in the takeoff or landing position, whichever is higher from the ground.

\(2\) The assisting means must be usable and self-supporting with one or more landing gear legs collapsed and under a 25-knot wind directed from the most critical angle.

\(3\) The assisting means provided for each escape route leading from a Type A or B emergency exit must be capable of carrying simultaneously two parallel lines of evacuees; and, the assisting means leading from any other exit type must be capable of carrying as many parallel lines of evacuees as there are required escape routes.

\(4\) The assisting means provided for each escape route leading from a Type C exit must be automatically erected within 10 seconds from the time the opening means of the exit is actuated, and that provided for the escape route leading from any other exit type must be automatically erected within 10 seconds after actuation of the erection system.

\(e\) If an integral stair is installed in a passenger entry door that is qualified as a passenger emergency exit, the stair must be designed so that, under the following conditions, the effectiveness of passenger emergency egress will not be impaired:

\(1\) The door, integral stair, and operating mechanism have been subjected to the inertia forces specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]](b)(3), acting separately relative to the surrounding structure.

\(2\) The airplane is in the normal ground attitude and in each of the attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs of the landing gear.

\[Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29782, July 20, 1990, as amended by Amdt. 25-88, 61 FR 57958, Nov. 8, 1996; 62 FR 1817, Jan. 13, 1997; Amdt. 25-114, 69 FR 24502, May 3, 2004\]

### §25.811   Emergency exit marking.

\(a\) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of opening must be conspicuously marked.

\(b\) The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin.

\(c\) Means must be provided to assist the occupants in locating the exits in conditions of dense smoke.

\(d\) The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle (or aisles). There must be—

\(1\) A passenger emergency exit locator sign above the aisle (or aisles) near each passenger emergency exit, or at another overhead location if it is more practical because of low headroom, except that one sign may serve more than one exit if each exit can be seen readily from the sign;

\(2\) A passenger emergency exit marking sign next to each passenger emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from the sign; and

\(3\) A sign on each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision along the passenger cabin to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by the bulkhead or divider, except that if this is not possible the sign may be placed at another appropriate location.

\(e\) The location of the operating handle and instructions for opening exits from the inside of the airplane must be shown in the following manner:

\(1\) Each passenger emergency exit must have, on or near the exit, a marking that is readable from a distance of 30 inches.

\(2\) Each Type A, Type B, Type C or Type I passenger emergency exit operating handle must—

\(i\) Be self-illuminated with an initial brightness of at least 160 microlamberts; or

\(ii\) Be conspicuously located and well illuminated by the emergency lighting even in conditions of occupant crowding at the exit.

\(3\) \[Reserved\]

\(4\) Each Type A, Type B, Type C, Type I, or Type II passenger emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle must be marked—

\(i\) With a red arrow, with a shaft at least three-fourths of an inch wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70 degrees of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length.

\(ii\) So that the centerline of the exit handle is within ±1 inch of the projected point of the arrow when the handle has reached full travel and has released the locking mechanism, and

\(iii\) With the word “open” in red letters 1 inch high, placed horizontally near the head of the arrow.

\(f\) Each emergency exit that is required to be openable from the outside, and its means of opening, must be marked on the outside of the airplane. In addition, the following apply:

\(1\) The outside marking for each passenger emergency exit in the side of the fuselage must include a 2-inch colored band outlining the exit.

\(2\) Each outside marking including the band, must have color contrast to be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage surface. The contrast must be such that if the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent. “Reflectance” is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives. When the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least a 30-percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.

\(3\) In the case of exists other than those in the side of the fuselage, such as ventral or tailcone exists, the external means of opening, including instructions if applicable, must be conspicuously marked in red, or bright chrome yellow if the background color is such that red is inconspicuous. When the opening means is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking to that effect must be provided on the other side.

\(g\) Each sign required by paragraph (d) of this section may use the word “exit” in its legend in place of the term “emergency exit”.

\[Amdt. 25-15, 32 FR 13264, Sept. 20, 1967, as amended by Amdt. 25-32, 37 FR 3970, Feb. 24, 1972; Amdt. 25-46, 43 FR 50597, Oct. 30, 1978; 43 FR 52495, Nov. 13, 1978; Amdt. 25-79, 58 FR 45229, Aug. 26, 1993; Amdt. 25-88, 61 FR 57958, Nov. 8, 1996\]

### §25.812   Emergency lighting.

\(a\) An emergency lighting system, independent of the main lighting system, must be installed. However, the sources of general cabin illumination may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting systems if the power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the power supply to the main lighting system. The emergency lighting system must include:

\(1\) Illuminated emergency exit marking and locating signs, sources of general cabin illumination, interior lighting in emergency exit areas, and floor proximity escape path marking.

\(2\) Exterior emergency lighting.

\(b\) Emergency exit signs—

\(1\) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 10 seats or more must meet the following requirements:

\(i\) Each passenger emergency exit locator sign required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.811   Emergency exit marking.\|§25.811]](d)(1) and each passenger emergency exit marking sign required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.811   Emergency exit marking.\|§25.811]](d)(2) must have red letters at least 11⁄2 inches high on an illuminated white background, and must have an area of at least 21 square inches excluding the letters. The lighted background-to-letter contrast must be at least 10:1. The letter height to stroke-width ratio may not be more than 7:1 nor less than 6:1. These signs must be internally electrically illuminated with a background brightness of at least 25 foot-lamberts and a high-to-low background contrast no greater than 3:1.

\(ii\) Each passenger emergency exit sign required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.811   Emergency exit marking.\|§25.811]](d)(3) must have red letters at least 11⁄2 inches high on a white background having an area of at least 21 square inches excluding the letters. These signs must be internally electrically illuminated or self-illuminated by other than electrical means and must have an initial brightness of at least 400 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed in the case of a sign that is self-illuminated by other than electrical means.

\(2\) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of nine seats or less, that are required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.811   Emergency exit marking.\|§25.811]](d)(1), (2), and (3) must have red letters at least 1 inch high on a white background at least 2 inches high. These signs may be internally electrically illuminated, or self-illuminated by other than electrical means, with an initial brightness of at least 160 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed in the case of a sign that is self-illuminated by other than electrical means.

\(c\) General illumination in the passenger cabin must be provided so that when measured along the centerline of main passenger aisle(s), and cross aisle(s) between main aisles, at seat arm-rest height and at 40-inch intervals, the average illumination is not less than 0.05 foot-candle and the illumination at each 40-inch interval is not less than 0.01 foot-candle. A main passenger aisle(s) is considered to extend along the fuselage from the most forward passenger emergency exit or cabin occupant seat, whichever is farther forward, to the most rearward passenger emergency exit or cabin occupant seat, whichever is farther aft.

\(d\) The floor of the passageway leading to each floor-level passenger emergency exit, between the main aisles and the exit openings, must be provided with illumination that is not less than 0.02 foot-candle measured along a line that is within 6 inches of and parallel to the floor and is centered on the passenger evacuation path.

\(e\) Floor proximity emergency escape path marking must provide emergency evacuation guidance for passengers when all sources of illumination more than 4 feet above the cabin aisle floor are totally obscured. In the dark of the night, the floor proximity emergency escape path marking must enable each passenger to—

\(1\) After leaving the passenger seat, visually identify the emergency escape path along the cabin aisle floor to the first exits or pair of exits forward and aft of the seat; and

\(2\) Readily identify each exit from the emergency escape path by reference only to markings and visual features not more than 4 feet above the cabin floor.

\(f\) Except for subsystems provided in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of the airplane's main emergency lighting system, and are automatically activated when the assist means is erected, the emergency lighting system must be designed as follows.

\(1\) The lights must be operable manually from the flight crew station and from a point in the passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a normal flight attendant seat.

\(2\) There must be a flight crew warning light which illuminates when power is on in the airplane and the emergency lighting control device is not armed.

\(3\) The cockpit control device must have an “on,” “off,” and “armed” position so that when armed in the cockpit or turned on at either the cockpit or flight attendant station the lights will either light or remain lighted upon interruption (except an interruption caused by a transverse vertical separation of the fuselage during crash landing) of the airplane's normal electric power. There must be a means to safeguard against inadvertent operation of the control device from the “armed” or “on” positions.

\(g\) Exterior emergency lighting must be provided as follows:

### §25.813   Emergency exit access.

Each required emergency exit must be accessible to the passengers and located where it will afford an effective means of evacuation. Emergency exit distribution must be as uniform as practical, taking passenger distribution into account; however, the size and location of exits on both sides of the cabin need not be symmetrical. If only one floor level exit per side is prescribed, and the airplane does not have a tailcone or ventral emergency exit, the floor level exit must be in the rearward part of the passenger compartment, unless another location affords a more effective means of passenger evacuation. Where more than one floor level exit per side is prescribed, at least one floor level exit per side must be located near each end of the cabin, except that this provision does not apply to combination cargo/passenger configurations. In addition—

\(a\) There must be a passageway leading from the nearest main aisle to each Type A, Type B, Type C, Type I, or Type II emergency exit and between individual passenger areas. Each passageway leading to a Type A or Type B exit must be unobstructed and at least 36 inches wide. Passageways between individual passenger areas and those leading to Type I, Type II, or Type C emergency exits must be unobstructed and at least 20 inches wide. Unless there are two or more main aisles, each Type A or B exit must be located so that there is passenger flow along the main aisle to that exit from both the forward and aft directions. If two or more main aisles are provided, there must be unobstructed cross-aisles at least 20 inches wide between main aisles. There must be—

\(1\) A cross-aisle which leads directly to each passageway between the nearest main aisle and a Type A or B exit; and

\(2\) A cross-aisle which leads to the immediate vicinity of each passageway between the nearest main aisle and a Type 1, Type II, or Type III exit; except that when two Type III exits are located within three passenger rows of each other, a single cross-aisle may be used if it leads to the vicinity between the passageways from the nearest main aisle to each exit.

\(b\) Adequate space to allow crewmember(s) to assist in the evacuation of passengers must be provided as follows:

\(1\) Each assist space must be a rectangle on the floor, of sufficient size to enable a crewmember, standing erect, to effectively assist evacuees. The assist space must not reduce the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required for the exit.

\(2\) For each Type A or B exit, assist space must be provided at each side of the exit regardless of whether an assist means is required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.810   Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.\|§25.810]](a).

\(3\) For each Type C, I or II exit installed in an airplane with seating for more than 80 passengers, an assist space must be provided at one side of the passageway regardless of whether an assist means is required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.810   Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.\|§25.810]](a).

\(4\) For each Type C, I or II exit, an assist space must be provided at one side of the passageway if an assist means is required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.810   Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.\|§25.810]](a).

\(5\) For any tailcone exit that qualifies for 25 additional passenger seats under the provisions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.807   Emergency exits.\|§25.807]](g)(9)(ii), an assist space must be provided, if an assist means is required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.810   Emergency egress assist means and escape routes.\|§25.810]](a).

\(6\) There must be a handle, or handles, at each assist space, located to enable the crewmember to steady himself or herself:

\(i\) While manually activating the assist means (where applicable) and,

\(ii\) While assisting passengers during an evacuation.

\(c\) The following must be provided for each Type III or Type IV exit—(1) There must be access from the nearest aisle to each exit. In addition, for each Type III exit in an airplane that has a passenger seating configuration of 60 or more—

\(i\) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii), the access must be provided by an unobstructed passageway that is at least 10 inches in width for interior arrangements in which the adjacent seat rows on the exit side of the aisle contain no more than two seats, or 20 inches in width for interior arrangements in which those rows contain three seats. The width of the passageway must be measured with adjacent seats adjusted to their most adverse position. The centerline of the required passageway width must not be displaced more than 5 inches horizontally from that of the exit.

\(ii\) In lieu of one 10- or 20-inch passageway, there may be two passageways, between seat rows only, that must be at least 6 inches in width and lead to an unobstructed space adjacent to each exit. (Adjacent exits must not share a common passageway.) The width of the passageways must be measured with adjacent seats adjusted to their most adverse position. The unobstructed space adjacent to the exit must extend vertically from the floor to the ceiling (or bottom of sidewall stowage bins), inboard from the exit for a distance not less than the width of the narrowest passenger seat installed on the airplane, and from the forward edge of the forward passageway to the aft edge of the aft passageway. The exit opening must be totally within the fore and aft bounds of the unobstructed space.

\(2\) In addition to the access—

\(i\) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 20 or more, the projected opening of the exit provided must not be obstructed and there must be no interference in opening the exit by seats, berths, or other protrusions (including any seatback in the most adverse position) for a distance from that exit not less than the width of the narrowest passenger seat installed on the airplane.

\(ii\) For airplanes that have a passenger seating configuration of 19 or fewer, there may be minor obstructions in this region, if there are compensating factors to maintain the effectiveness of the exit.

\(3\) For each Type III exit, regardless of the passenger capacity of the airplane in which it is installed, there must be placards that—

\(i\) Are readable by all persons seated adjacent to and facing a passageway to the exit;

\(ii\) Accurately state or illustrate the proper method of opening the exit, including the use of handholds; and

\(iii\) If the exit is a removable hatch, state the weight of the hatch and indicate an appropriate location to place the hatch after removal.

\(d\) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must be unobstructed. However, curtains may be used if they allow free entry through the passageway.

\(e\) No door may be installed between any passenger seat that is occupiable for takeoff and landing and any passenger emergency exit, such that the door crosses any egress path (including aisles, crossaisles and passageways).

\(f\) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating any crewmember seat (except those seats on the flightdeck), occupiable for takeoff and landing, from any emergency exit, the door must have a means to latch it in the open position. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding structure, listed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.561   General.\|§25.561]](b).

### §25.819   Lower deck service compartments (including galleys).

For airplanes with a service compartment located below the main deck, which may be occupied during taxi or flight but not during takeoff or landing, the following apply:

\(a\) There must be at least two emergency evacuation routes, one at each end of each lower deck service compartment or two having sufficient separation within each compartment, which could be used by each occupant of the lower deck service compartment to rapidly evacuate to the main deck under normal and emergency lighting conditions. The routes must provide for the evacuation of incapacitated persons, with assistance. The use of the evacuation routes may not be dependent on any powered device. The routes must be designed to minimize the possibility of blockage which might result from fire, mechanical or structural failure, or persons standing on top of or against the escape routes. In the event the airplane's main power system or compartment main lighting system should fail, emergency illumination for each lower deck service compartment must be automatically provided.

\(b\) There must be a means for two-way voice communication between the flight deck and each lower deck service compartment, which remains available following loss of normal electrical power generating system.

\(c\) There must be an aural emergency alarm system, audible during normal and emergency conditions, to enable crewmembers on the flight deck and at each required floor level emergency exit to alert occupants of each lower deck service compartment of an emergency situation.

\(d\) There must be a means, readily detectable by occupants of each lower deck service compartment, that indicates when seat belts should be fastened.

\(e\) If a public address system is installed in the airplane, speakers must be provided in each lower deck service compartment.

\(f\) For each occupant permitted in a lower deck service compartment, there must be a forward or aft facing seat which meets the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.785   Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses.\|§25.785]](d), and must be able to withstand maximum flight loads when occupied.

\(g\) For each powered lift system installed between a lower deck service compartment and the main deck for the carriage of persons or equipment, or both, the system must meet the following requirements:

\(1\) Each lift control switch outside the lift, except emergency stop buttons, must be designed to prevent the activation of the life if the lift door, or the hatch required by paragraph (g)(3) of this section, or both are open.

\(2\) An emergency stop button, that when activated will immediately stop the lift, must be installed within the lift and at each entrance to the lift.

\(3\) There must be a hatch capable of being used for evacuating persons from the lift that is openable from inside and outside the lift without tools, with the lift in any position.

\(a\) Under normal operating conditions and in the event of any probable failure conditions of any system which would adversely affect the ventilating air, the ventilation system must be designed to provide a sufficient amount of uncontaminated air to enable the crewmembers to perform their duties without undue discomfort or fatigue and to provide reasonable passenger comfort. For normal operating conditions, the ventilation system must be designed to provide each occupant with an airflow containing at least 0.55 pounds of fresh air per minute.

\(b\) Crew and passenger compartment air must be free from harmful or hazardous concentrations of gases or vapors. In meeting this requirement, the following apply:

\(1\) Carbon monoxide concentrations in excess of 1 part in 20,000 parts of air are considered hazardous. For test purposes, any acceptable carbon monoxide detection method may be used.

\(2\) Carbon dioxide concentration during flight must be shown not to exceed 0.5 percent by volume (sea level equivalent) in compartments normally occupied by passengers or crewmembers.

\(c\) There must be provisions made to ensure that the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section are met after reasonably probable failures or malfunctioning of the ventilating, heating, pressurization, or other systems and equipment.

\(d\) If accumulation of hazardous quantities of smoke in the cockpit area is reasonably probable, smoke evacuation must be readily accomplished, starting with full pressurization and without depressurizing beyond safe limits.

\(e\) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, means must be provided to enable the occupants of the following compartments and areas to control the temperature and quantity of ventilating air supplied to their compartment or area independently of the temperature and quantity of air supplied to other compartments and areas:

\(1\) The flight crew compartment.

\(2\) Crewmember compartments and areas other than the flight crew compartment unless the crewmember compartment or area is ventilated by air interchange with other compartments or areas under all operating conditions.

\(f\) Means to enable the flight crew to control the temperature and quantity of ventilating air supplied to the flight crew compartment independently of the temperature and quantity of ventilating air supplied to other compartments are not required if all of the following conditions are met:

\(1\) The total volume of the flight crew and passenger compartments is 800 cubic feet or less.

\(2\) The air inlets and passages for air to flow between flight crew and passenger compartments are arranged to provide compartment temperatures within 5 degrees F. of each other and adequate ventilation to occupants in both compartments.

\(3\) The temperature and ventilation controls are accessible to the flight crew.

\(g\) The exposure time at any given temperature must not exceed the values shown in the following graph after any improbable failure condition.

### §25.833   Combustion heating systems.

Combustion heaters must be approved.

\[Amdt. 25-72, 55 FR 29783, July 20, 1990\]

### Pressurization

### §25.841   Pressurized cabins.

\(a\) Pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be equipped to provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8,000 feet at the maximum operating altitude of the airplane under normal operating conditions.

\(1\) If certification for operation above 25,000 feet is requested, the airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of 15,000 feet after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system.

\(2\) The airplane must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin pressure altitude that exceeds the following after decompression from any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable:

\(i\) Twenty-five thousand (25,000) feet for more than 2 minutes; or

\(ii\) Forty thousand (40,000) feet for any duration.

\(3\) Fuselage structure, engine and system failures are to be considered in evaluating the cabin decompression.

\(b\) Pressurized cabins must have at least the following valves, controls, and indicators for controlling cabin pressure:

\(1\) Two pressure relief valves to automatically limit the positive pressure differential to a predetermined value at the maximum rate of flow delivered by the pressure source. The combined capacity of the relief valves must be large enough so that the failure of any one valve would not cause an appreciable rise in the pressure differential. The pressure differential is positive when the internal pressure is greater than the external.

\(2\) Two reverse pressure differential relief valves (or their equivalents) to automatically prevent a negative pressure differential that would damage the structure. One valve is enough, however, if it is of a design that reasonably precludes its malfunctioning.

\(3\) A means by which the pressure differential can be rapidly equalized.

\(4\) An automatic or manual regulator for controlling the intake or exhaust airflow, or both, for maintaining the required internal pressures and airflow rates.

\(5\) Instruments at the pilot or flight engineer station to show the pressure differential, the cabin pressure altitude, and the rate of change of the cabin pressure altitude.

\(6\) Warning indication at the pilot or flight engineer station to indicate when the safe or preset pressure differential and cabin pressure altitude limits are exceeded. Appropriate warning markings on the cabin pressure differential indicator meet the warning requirement for pressure differential limits and an aural or visual signal (in addition to cabin altitude indicating means) meets the warning requirement for cabin pressure altitude limits if it warns the flight crew when the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 10,000 feet.

\(7\) A warning placard at the pilot or flight engineer station if the structure is not designed for pressure differentials up to the maximum relief valve setting in combination with landing loads.

\(8\) The pressure sensors necessary to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1447   Equipment standards for oxygen dispensing units.\|§25.1447]](c), must be located and the sensing system designed so that, in the event of loss of cabin pressure in any passenger or crew compartment (including upper and lower lobe galleys), the warning and automatic presentation devices, required by those provisions, will be actuated without any delay that would significantly increase the hazards resulting from decompression.

\[Doc. No. 5066, 29 FR 18291, Dec. 24, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 25-38, 41 FR 55466, Dec. 20, 1976; Amdt. 25-87, 61 FR 28696, June 5, 1996\]

### §25.843   Tests for pressurized cabins.

\(a\) *Strength test.* The complete pressurized cabin, including doors, windows, and valves, must be tested as a pressure vessel for the pressure differential specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.365   Pressurized compartment loads.\|§25.365]](d).

\(b\) *Functional tests.* The following functional tests must be performed:

\(1\) Tests of the functioning and capacity of the positive and negative pressure differential valves, and of the emergency release valve, to stimulate the effects of closed regulator valves.

\(2\) Tests of the pressurization system to show proper functioning under each possible condition of pressure, temperature, and moisture, up to the maximum altitude for which certification is requested.

\(3\) Flight tests, to show the performance of the pressure supply, pressure and flow regulators, indicators, and warning signals, in steady and stepped climbs and descents at rates corresponding to the maximum attainable within the operating limitations of the airplane, up to the maximum altitude for which certification is requested.

\(4\) Tests of each door and emergency exit, to show that they operate properly after being subjected to the flight tests prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

### Fire Protection

### §25.851   Fire extinguishers.

\(a\) *Hand fire extinguishers.* (1) The following minimum number of hand fire extinguishers must be conveniently located and evenly distributed in passenger compartments:

\(5\) Fuel tank installations must be such that the tanks will not rupture as a result of the landing gear or an engine pylon or engine mount tearing away as specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.721   General.\|§25.721]](a) and (c).

\(ii\) If only one frequency of vibration resulting from any r.p.m. within the normal operating range of engine speeds is critical, that frequency of vibration must be the test frequency.

\(iii\) If more than one frequency of vibration resulting from any r.p.m. within the normal operating range of engine speeds is critical, the most critical of these frequencies must be the test frequency.

\(4\) Under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the time of test must be adjusted to accomplish the same number of vibration cycles that would be accomplished in 25 hours at the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

\(5\) During the test, the tank assembly must be rocked at the rate of 16 to 20 complete cycles per minute, through an angle of 15° on both sides of the horizontal (30° total), about the most critical axis, for 25 hours. If motion about more than one axis is likely to be critical, the tank must be rocked about each critical axis for 121⁄2 hours.

\(b\) If a fuel jettisoning system is required it must be capable of jettisoning enough fuel within 15 minutes, starting with the weight given in paragraph (a) of this section, to enable the airplane to meet the climb requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.119   Landing climb: All-engines-operating.\|§§25.119]] and 25.121(d), assuming that the fuel is jettisoned under the conditions, except weight, found least favorable during the flight tests prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

\(c\) Fuel jettisoning must be demonstrated beginning at maximum takeoff weight with flaps and landing gear up and in—

However, if there is an auxiliary control independent of the main jettisoning control, the system may be designed to jettison the remaining fuel by means of the auxiliary jettisoning control.

\(g\) The fuel jettisoning valve must be designed to allow flight personnel to close the valve during any part of the jettisoning operation.

### §25.1043   Cooling tests.

\(a\) *General.* Compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1041   General.\|§25.1041]] must be shown by tests, under critical ground, water, and flight operating conditions. For these tests, the following apply:

\(1\) If the tests are conducted under conditions deviating from the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature, the recorded powerplant temperatures must be corrected under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

\(2\) No corrected temperatures determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may exceed established limits.

\(3\) For reciprocating engines, the fuel used during the cooling tests must be the minimum grade approved for the engines, and the mixture settings must be those normally used in the flight stages for which the cooling tests are conducted. The test procedures must be as prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1045   Cooling test procedures.\|§25.1045]].

\(b\) *Maximum ambient atmospheric temperature.* A maximum ambient atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of at least 100 degrees F must be established. The assumed temperature lapse rate is 3.6 degrees F per thousand feet of altitude above sea level until a temperature of −69.7 degrees F is reached, above which altitude the temperature is considered constant at −69.7 degrees F. However, for winterization installations, the applicant may select a maximum ambient atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of less than 100 degrees F.

\(c\) *Correction factor (except cylinder barrels).* Unless a more rational correction applies, temperatures of engine fluids and powerplant components (except cylinder barrels) for which temperature limits are established, must be corrected by adding to them the difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum component or fluid temperature recorded during the cooling test.

\(d\) *Correction factor for cylinder barrel temperatures.* Unless a more rational correction applies, cylinder barrel temperatures must be corrected by adding to them 0.7 times the difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of the maximum cylinder barrel temperature recorded during the cooling test.

The cooling tests must be conducted with the airplane in the configuration, and operating under the conditions, that are critical relative to cooling during each stage of flight. For the cooling tests, a temperature is “stabilized” when its rate of change is less than two degrees F. per minute.

\(b\) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated, unless the entry condition normally is not one during which component and the engine fluid temperatures would stabilize (in which case, operation through the full entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight being investigated in order to allow temperatures to reach their natural levels at the time of entry). The takeoff cooling test must be preceded by a period during which the powerplant component and engine fluid temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground idle.

\(c\) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until—

\(1\) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;

\(2\) The stage of flight is completed; or

\(3\) An operating limitation is reached.

\(d\) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it may be assumed, for cooling test purposes, that the takeoff stage of flight is complete when the airplane reaches an altitude of 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface or reaches a point in the takeoff where the transition from the takeoff to the en route configuration is completed and a speed is reached at which compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.121   Climb: One-engine-inoperative.\|§25.121]](c) is shown, whichever point is at a higher altitude. The airplane must be in the following configuration:

\(2\) Wing flaps in the most favorable position.

\(3\) Cowl flaps (or other means of controlling the engine cooling supply) in the position that provides adequate cooling in the hot-day condition.

\(4\) Critical engine inoperative and its propeller stopped.

\(5\) Remaining engines at the maximum continuous power available for the altitude.

\(e\) For hull seaplanes and amphibians, cooling must be shown during taxiing downwind for 10 minutes, at five knots above step speed.

\(2\) For reciprocating engines, there are means to prevent the emergence of backfire flames.

\(d\) For turbine engine powered airplanes and airplanes incorporating auxiliary power units—

\(1\) There must be means to prevent hazardous quantities of fuel leakage or overflow from drains, vents, or other components of flammable fluid systems from entering the engine or auxiliary power unit intake system; and

\(2\) The airplane must be designed to prevent water or slush on the runway, taxiway, or other airport operating surfaces from being directed into the engine or auxiliary power unit air inlet ducts in hazardous quantities, and the air inlet ducts must be located or protected so as to minimize the ingestion of foreign matter during takeoff, landing, and taxiing.

\(e\) If the engine induction system contains parts or components that could be damaged by foreign objects entering the air inlet, it must be shown by tests or, if appropriate, by analysis that the induction system design can withstand the foreign object ingestion test conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines#§33.76   Bird ingestion.\|§§33.76]], 33.77 and 33.78(a)(1) of this chapter without failure of parts or components that could create a hazard.

For each airspeed indicating system, the following apply:

\(a\) Each airspeed indicating instrument must be approved and must be calibrated to indicate true airspeed (at sea level with a standard atmosphere) with a minimum practicable instrument calibration error when the corresponding pitot and static pressures are applied.

\(b\) Each system must be calibrated to determine the system error (that is, the relation between IAS and CAS) in flight and during the accelerated takeoff ground run. The ground run calibration must be determined—

\(1\) From 0.8 of the minimum value of V1 to the maximum value of V2, considering the approved ranges of altitude and weight; and

\(2\) With the flaps and power settings corresponding to the values determined in the establishment of the takeoff path under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.111   Takeoff path.\|§25.111]] assuming that the critical engine fails at the minimum value of V1.

\(c\) The airspeed error of the installation, excluding the airspeed indicator instrument calibration error, may not exceed three percent or five knots, whichever is greater, throughout the speed range, from—

\(1\) *VMO* to 1.23 *VSR*1, with flaps retracted; and

\(2\) 1.23 *VSR*0 to *V*FE with flaps in the landing position.

\(e\) From VMO to VMO + 2⁄3 (VDF − VMO), the IAS must change perceptibly with CAS and in the same sense, and at higher speeds up to VDF the IAS must not change in an incorrect sense.

\(f\) There must be no indication of airspeed that would cause undue difficulty to the pilot during the takeoff between the initiation of rotation and the achievement of a steady climbing condition.

\(g\) The effects of airspeed indicating system lag may not introduce significant takeoff indicated airspeed bias, or significant errors in takeoff or accelerate-stop distances.

\(h\) Each system must be arranged, so far as practicable, to prevent malfunction or serious error due to the entry of moisture, dirt, or other substances.

### §25.1325   Static pressure systems.

\(a\) Each instrument with static air case connections must be vented to the outside atmosphere through an appropriate piping system.

\(b\) Each static port must be designed and located so that:

\(c\) The design and installation of the static pressure system must be such that—

\(1\) Positive drainage of moisture is provided; chafing of the tubing and excessive distortion or restriction at bends in the tubing is avoided; and the materials used are durable, suitable for the purpose intended, and protected against corrosion; and

\(2\) It is airtight except for the port into the atmosphere. A proof test must be conducted to demonstrate the integrity of the static pressure system in the following manner:

\(i\) *Unpressurized airplanes.* Evacuate the static pressure system to a pressure differential of approximately 1 inch of mercury or to a reading on the altimeter, 1,000 feet above the airplane elevation at the time of the test. Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, the loss of indicated altitude must not exceed 100 feet on the altimeter.

\(ii\) *Pressurized airplanes.* Evacuate the static pressure system until a pressure differential equivalent to the maximum cabin pressure differential for which the airplane is type certificated is achieved. Without additional pumping for a period of 1 minute, the loss of indicated altitude must not exceed 2 percent of the equivalent altitude of the maximum cabin differential pressure or 100 feet, whichever is greater.

\(d\) Each pressure altimeter must be approved and must be calibrated to indicate pressure altitude in a standard atmosphere, with a minimum practicable calibration error when the corresponding static pressures are applied.

\(e\) Each system must be designed and installed so that the error in indicated pressure altitude, at sea level, with a standard atmosphere, excluding instrument calibration error, does not result in an error of more than ±30 feet per 100 knots speed for the appropriate configuration in the speed range between 1.23 *VSR*0 with flaps extended and 1.7 *VSR*1 with flaps retracted. However, the error need not be less than ±30 feet.

\(f\) If an altimeter system is fitted with a device that provides corrections to the altimeter indication, the device must be designed and installed in such manner that it can be bypassed when it malfunctions, unless an alternate altimeter system is provided. Each correction device must be fitted with a means for indicating the occurrence of reasonably probable malfunctions, including power failure, to the flight crew. The indicating means must be effective for any cockpit lighting condition likely to occur.

\(g\) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, if the static pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate static pressure source, the means for selecting one or the other source must be designed so that—

\(1\) When either source is selected, the other is blocked off; and

\(2\) Both sources cannot be blocked off simultaneously.

\(h\) For unpressurized airplanes, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply if it can be demonstrated that the static pressure system calibration, when either static pressure source is selected, is not changed by the other static pressure source being open or blocked.

\(a\) The indication provided must incorporate an amber light that is in clear view of a flight crewmember.

\(b\) The indication provided must be designed to alert the flight crew if either of the following conditions exist:

\(1\) The pitot heating system is switched “off”.

\(2\) The pitot heating system is switched “on” and any pitot tube heating element is inoperative.

\[Amdt. 25-43, 43 FR 10339, Mar. 13, 1978\]

### §25.1327   Magnetic direction indicator.

\(a\) Each magnetic direction indicator must be installed so that its accuracy is not excessively affected by the airplane's vibration or magnetic fields.

\(b\) The compensated installation may not have a deviation, in level flight, greater than 10 degrees on any heading.

### §25.1329   Flight guidance system.

\(a\) Quick disengagement controls for the autopilot and autothrust functions must be provided for each pilot. The autopilot quick disengagement controls must be located on both control wheels (or equivalent). The autothrust quick disengagement controls must be located on the thrust control levers. Quick disengagement controls must be readily accessible to each pilot while operating the control wheel (or equivalent) and thrust control levers.

\(b\) The effects of a failure of the system to disengage the autopilot or autothrust functions when manually commanded by the pilot must be assessed in accordance with the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1309   Equipment, systems, and installations.\|§25.1309]].

\(c\) Engagement or switching of the flight guidance system, a mode, or a sensor may not cause a transient response of the airplane's flight path any greater than a minor transient, as defined in paragraph (n)(1) of this section.

\(d\) Under normal conditions, the disengagement of any automatic control function of a flight guidance system may not cause a transient response of the airplane's flight path any greater than a minor transient.

\(e\) Under rare normal and non-normal conditions, disengagement of any automatic control function of a flight guidance system may not result in a transient any greater than a significant transient, as defined in paragraph (n)(2) of this section.

\(f\) The function and direction of motion of each command reference control, such as heading select or vertical speed, must be plainly indicated on, or adjacent to, each control if necessary to prevent inappropriate use or confusion.

\(g\) Under any condition of flight appropriate to its use, the flight guidance system may not produce hazardous loads on the airplane, nor create hazardous deviations in the flight path. This applies to both fault-free operation and in the event of a malfunction, and assumes that the pilot begins corrective action within a reasonable period of time.

\(h\) When the flight guidance system is in use, a means must be provided to avoid excursions beyond an acceptable margin from the speed range of the normal flight envelope. If the airplane experiences an excursion outside this range, a means must be provided to prevent the flight guidance system from providing guidance or control to an unsafe speed.

\(i\) The flight guidance system functions, controls, indications, and alerts must be designed to minimize flightcrew errors and confusion concerning the behavior and operation of the flight guidance system. Means must be provided to indicate the current mode of operation, including any armed modes, transitions, and reversions. Selector switch position is not an acceptable means of indication. The controls and indications must be grouped and presented in a logical and consistent manner. The indications must be visible to each pilot under all expected lighting conditions.

\(j\) Following disengagement of the autopilot, a warning (visual and auditory) must be provided to each pilot and be timely and distinct from all other cockpit warnings.

\(k\) Following disengagement of the autothrust function, a caution must be provided to each pilot.

\(l\) The autopilot may not create a potential hazard when the flightcrew applies an override force to the flight controls.

\(m\) During autothrust operation, it must be possible for the flightcrew to move the thrust levers without requiring excessive force. The autothrust may not create a potential hazard when the flightcrew applies an override force to the thrust levers.

\(n\) For purposes of this section, a transient is a disturbance in the control or flight path of the airplane that is not consistent with response to flightcrew inputs or environmental conditions.

\(1\) A minor transient would not significantly reduce safety margins and would involve flightcrew actions that are well within their capabilities. A minor transient may involve a slight increase in flightcrew workload or some physical discomfort to passengers or cabin crew.

\(2\) A significant transient may lead to a significant reduction in safety margins, an increase in flightcrew workload, discomfort to the flightcrew, or physical distress to the passengers or cabin crew, possibly including non-fatal injuries. Significant transients do not require, in order to remain within or recover to the normal flight envelope, any of the following:

\(i\) Exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength.

\(ii\) Forces applied by the pilot which are greater than those specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.143   General.\|§25.143]](c).

\(iii\) Accelerations or attitudes in the airplane that might result in further hazard to secured or non-secured occupants.

\(1\) Each instrument must have a visual means integral with, the instrument, to indicate when power adequate to sustain proper instrument performance is not being supplied. The power must be measured at or near the point where it enters the instruments. For electric instruments, the power is considered to be adequate when the voltage is within approved limits.

\(2\) Each instrument must, in the event of the failure of one power source, be supplied by another power source. This may be accomplished automatically or by manual means.

\(3\) If an instrument presenting navigation data receives information from sources external to that instrument and loss of that information would render the presented data unreliable, the instrument must incorporate a visual means to warn the crew, when such loss of information occurs, that the presented data should not be relied upon.

\(b\) As used in this section, “instrument” includes devices that are physically contained in one unit, and devices that are composed of two or more physically separate units or components connected together (such as a remote indicating gyroscopic direction indicator that includes a magnetic sensing element, a gyroscopic unit, an amplifier and an indicator connected together).

### Appendix C to Part 25

### Part I—Atmospheric Icing Conditions

\(a\) *Continuous maximum icing.* The maximum continuous intensity of atmospheric icing conditions (continuous maximum icing) is defined by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the interrelationship of these three variables as shown in figure 1 of this appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and temperature is given in figure 2 of this appendix. The inter-relationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is determined from figures 1 and 2. The cloud liquid water content for continuous maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 17.4 nautical miles, is determined by the value of liquid water content of figure 1, multiplied by the appropriate factor from figure 3 of this appendix.

\(b\) *Intermittent maximum icing.* The intermittent maximum intensity of atmospheric icing conditions (intermittent maximum icing) is defined by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the interrelationship of these three variables as shown in figure 4 of this appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and temperature is given in figure 5 of this appendix. The inter-relationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is determined from figures 4 and 5. The cloud liquid water content for intermittent maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 2.6 nautical miles, is determined by the value of cloud liquid water content of figure 4 multiplied by the appropriate factor in figure 6 of this appendix.

\(c\) *Takeoff maximum icing.* The maximum intensity of atmospheric icing conditions for takeoff (takeoff maximum icing) is defined by the cloud liquid water content of 0.35 g/m3, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets of 20 microns, and the ambient air temperature at ground level of minus 9 degrees Celsius (−9 °C). The takeoff maximum icing conditions extend from ground level to a height of 1,500 feet above the level of the takeoff surface.

### Part II—Airframe Ice Accretions for Showing Compliance With Subpart B.

\(a\) *Ice accretions—General.* The most critical ice accretion in terms of airplane performance and handling qualities for each flight phase must be used to show compliance with the applicable airplane performance and handling requirements in icing conditions of subpart B of this part. Applicants must demonstrate that the full range of atmospheric icing conditions specified in part I of this appendix have been considered, including the mean effective drop diameter, liquid water content, and temperature appropriate to the flight conditions (for example, configuration, speed, angle-of-attack, and altitude). The ice accretions for each flight phase are defined as follows:

\(1\) *Takeoff ice* is the most critical ice accretion on unprotected surfaces and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, occurring between the end of the takeoff distance and 400 feet above the takeoff surface, assuming accretion starts at the end of the takeoff distance in the takeoff maximum icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix.

\(2\) *Final takeoff ice* is the most critical ice accretion on unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, between 400 feet and either 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface, or the height at which the transition from the takeoff to the en route configuration is completed and VFTO is reached, whichever is higher. Ice accretion is assumed to start at the end of the takeoff distance in the takeoff maximum icing conditions of part I, paragraph (c) of this Appendix.

\(3\) *En route ice* is the critical ice accretion on the unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, during the en route phase.

\(4\) *Holding ice* is the critical ice accretion on the unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, during the holding flight phase.

\(5\) *Approach ice* is the critical ice accretion on the unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation following exit from the holding flight phase and transition to the most critical approach configuration.

\(6\) *Landing ice* is the critical ice accretion on the unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation following exit from the approach flight phase and transition to the final landing configuration.

\(b\) In order to reduce the number of ice accretions to be considered when demonstrating compliance with the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), any of the ice accretions defined in paragraph (a) of this section may be used for any other flight phase if it is shown to be more critical than the specific ice accretion defined for that flight phase. Configuration differences and their effects on ice accretions must be taken into account.

\(c\) The ice accretion that has the most adverse effect on handling qualities may be used for airplane performance tests provided any difference in performance is conservatively taken into account.

\(d\) For both unprotected and protected parts, the ice accretion for the takeoff phase may be determined by calculation, assuming the takeoff maximum icing conditions defined in appendix C, and assuming that:

\(1\) Airfoils, control surfaces and, if applicable, propellers are free from frost, snow, or ice at the start of the takeoff;

\(2\) The ice accretion starts at the end of the takeoff distance.

\(3\) The critical ratio of thrust/power-to-weight;

\(4\) Failure of the critical engine occurs at VEF; and

\(5\) Crew activation of the ice protection system is in accordance with a normal operating procedure provided in the Airplane Flight Manual, except that after beginning the takeoff roll, it must be assumed that the crew takes no action to activate the ice protection system until the airplane is at least 400 feet above the takeoff surface.

\(e\) The ice accretion before the ice protection system has been activated and is performing its intended function is the critical ice accretion formed on the unprotected and normally protected surfaces before activation and effective operation of the ice protection system in continuous maximum atmospheric icing conditions. This ice accretion only applies in showing compliance to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.143   General.\|§§25.143]](j) and 25.207(h), and 25.207(i).

### Appendix D to Part 25

*Criteria for determining minimum flight crew.* The following are considered by the Agency in determining the minimum flight crew under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.1523   Minimum flight crew.\|§25.1523]]:

\(a\) *Basic workload functions.* The following basic workload functions are considered:

\(1\) Flight path control.

\(2\) Collision avoidance.

\(3\) Navigation.

\(4\) Communications.

\(5\) Operation and monitoring of aircraft engines and systems.

\(6\) Command decisions.

\(b\) *Workload factors.* The following workload factors are considered significant when analyzing and demonstrating workload for minimum flight crew determination:

\(1\) The accessibility, ease, and simplicity of operation of all necessary flight, power, and equipment controls, including emergency fuel shutoff valves, electrical controls, electronic controls, pressurization system controls, and engine controls.

\(2\) The accessibility and conspicuity of all necessary instruments and failure warning devices such as fire warning, electrical system malfunction, and other failure or caution indicators. The extent to which such instruments or devices direct the proper corrective action is also considered.

\(3\) The number, urgency, and complexity of operating procedures with particular consideration given to the specific fuel management schedule imposed by center of gravity, structural or other considerations of an airworthiness nature, and to the ability of each engine to operate at all times from a single tank or source which is automatically replenished if fuel is also stored in other tanks.

\(4\) The degree and duration of concentrated mental and physical effort involved in normal operation and in diagnosing and coping with malfunctions and emergencies.

\(5\) The extent of required monitoring of the fuel, hydraulic, pressurization, electrical, electronic, deicing, and other systems while en route.

\(6\) The actions requiring a crewmember to be unavailable at his assigned duty station, including: observation of systems, emergency operation of any control, and emergencies in any compartment.

\(7\) The degree of automation provided in the aircraft systems to afford (after failures or malfunctions) automatic crossover or isolation of difficulties to minimize the need for flight crew action to guard against loss of hydraulic or electric power to flight controls or to other essential systems.

\(8\) The communications and navigation workload.

\(9\) The possibility of increased workload associated with any emergency that may lead to other emergencies.

\(10\) Incapacitation of a flight crewmember whenever the applicable operating rule requires a minimum flight crew of at least two pilots.

\(c\) *Kind of operation authorized.* The determination of the kind of operation authorized requires consideration of the operating rules under which the airplane will be operated. Unless an applicant desires approval for a more limited kind of operation. It is assumed that each airplane certificated under this Part will operate under IFR conditions.

### Appendix E to Part 25

### I—Limited Weight Credit For Airplanes Equipped With Standby Power

\(a\) Each applicant for an increase in the maximum certificated takeoff and landing weights of an airplane equipped with a type-certificated standby power rocket engine may obtain an increase as specified in paragraph (b) if—

\(1\) The installation of the rocket engine has been approved and it has been established by flight test that the rocket engine and its controls can be operated safely and reliably at the increase in maximum weight; and

\(2\) The Airplane Flight Manual, or the placard, markings or manuals required in place thereof, set forth in addition to any other operating limitations the Administrator may require, the increased weight approved under this regulation and a prohibition against the operation of the airplane at the approved increased weight when—

\(i\) The installed standby power rocket engines have been stored or installed in excess of the time limit established by the manufacturer of the rocket engine (usually stenciled on the engine casing); or

\(ii\) The rocket engine fuel has been expended or discharged.

\(b\) The currently approved maximum takeoff and landing weights at which an airplane is certificated without a standby power rocket engine installation may be increased by an amount that does not exceed any of the following:

\(1\) An amount equal in pounds to 0.014 IN, where I is the maximum usable impulse in pounds-seconds available from each standby power rocket engine and N is the number of rocket engines installed.

\(2\) An amount equal to 5 percent of the maximum certificated weight approved in accordance with the applicable airworthiness regulations without standby power rocket engines installed.

\(3\) An amount equal to the weight of the rocket engine installation.

\(4\) An amount that, together with the currently approved maximum weight, would equal the maximum structural weight established for the airplane without standby rocket engines installed.

### II—Performance Credit for Transport Category Airplanes Equipped With Standby Power

The Administrator may grant performance credit for the use of standby power on transport category airplanes. However, the performance credit applies only to the maximum certificated takeoff and landing weights, the takeoff distance, and the takeoff paths, and may not exceed that found by the Administrator to result in an overall level of safety in the takeoff, approach, and landing regimes of flight equivalent to that prescribed in the regulations under which the airplane was originally certificated without standby power. For the purposes of this appendix, “standby power” is power or thrust, or both, obtained from rocket engines for a relatively short period and actuated only in cases of emergency. The following provisions apply:

\(1\) *Takeoff; general.* The takeoff data prescribed in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this appendix must be determined at all weights and altitudes, and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied.

\(2\) *Takeoff path.*

\(a\) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path with standby power in use must be determined in accordance with the performance requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations.

\(b\) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path (excluding that part where the airplane is on or just above the takeoff surface) determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must lie above the one-engine-inoperative takeoff path without standby power at the maximum takeoff weight at which all of the applicable air-worthiness requirements are met. For the purpose of this comparison, the flight path is considered to extend to at least a height of 400 feet above the takeoff surface.

\(c\) The takeoff path with all engines operating, but without the use of standby power, must reflect a conservatively greater overall level of performance than the one-engine-inoperative takeoff path established in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The margin must be established by the Administrator to insure safe day-to-day operations, but in no case may it be less than 15 percent. The all-engines-operating takeoff path must be determined by a procedure consistent with that established in complying with paragraph (a) of this section.

\(d\) For reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes, the takeoff path to be scheduled in the Airplane Flight Manual must represent the one-engine-operative takeoff path determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and modified to reflect the procedure (see paragraph (6)) established by the applicant for flap retraction and attainment of the en route speed. The scheduled takeoff path must have a positive slope at all points of the airborne portion and at no point must it lie above the takeoff path specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

\(3\) *Takeoff distance.* The takeoff distance must be the horizontal distance along the one-engine-inoperative take off path determined in accordance with paragraph (2)(a) from the start of the takeoff to the point where the airplane attains a height of 50 feet above the takeoff surface for reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes and a height of 35 feet above the takeoff surface for turbine-powered airplanes.

\(4\) *Maximum certificated takeoff weights.* The maximum certificated takeoff weights must be determined at all altitudes, and at ambient temperatures, if applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied and may not exceed the weights established in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

\(a\) The conditions of paragraphs (2)(b) through (d) must be met at the maximum certificated takeoff weight.

\(b\) Without the use of standby power, the airplane must meet all of the en route requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations under which the airplane was originally certificated. In addition, turbine-powered airplanes without the use of standby power must meet the final takeoff climb requirements prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations.

\(5\) *Maximum certificated landing weights.*

\(a\) The maximum certificated landing weights (one-engine-inoperative approach and all-engine-operating landing climb) must be determined at all altitudes, and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied and must not exceed that established in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section.

\(b\) The flight path, with the engines operating at the power or thrust, or both, appropriate to the airplane configuration and with standby power in use, must lie above the flight path without standby power in use at the maximum weight at which all of the applicable airworthiness requirements are met. In addition, the flight paths must comply with subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.

\(i\) The flight paths must be established without changing the appropriate airplane configuration.

\(ii\) The flight paths must be carried out for a minimum height of 400 feet above the point where standby power is actuated.

\(6\) *Airplane configuration, speed, and power and thrust; general.* Any change in the airplane's configuration, speed, and power or thrust, or both, must be made in accordance with the procedures established by the applicant for the operation of the airplane in service and must comply with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. In addition, procedures must be established for the execution of balked landings and missed approaches.

\(a\) The Administrator must find that the procedure can be consistently executed in service by crews of average skill.

\(b\) The procedure may not involve methods or the use of devices which have not been proven to be safe and reliable.

\(c\) Allowances must be made for such time delays in the execution of the procedures as may be reasonably expected to occur during service.

\(7\) *Installation and operation; standby power.* The standby power unit and its installation must comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

\(a\) The standby power unit and its installation must not adversely affect the safety of the airplane.

\(b\) The operation of the standby power unit and its control must have proven to be safe and reliable.

\(8\) *Burn length.* Burn length is the distance from the original edge to the farthest evidence of damage to the test specimen due to flame impingement, including areas of partial or complete consumption, charring, or embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, warped, or discolored, nor areas where material has shrunk or melted away from the heat source.

### Part II—Flammability of Seat Cushions

\(a\) *Criteria for Acceptance.* Each seat cushion must meet the following criteria:

\(1\) At least three sets of seat bottom and seat back cushion specimens must be tested.

\(2\) If the cushion is constructed with a fire blocking material, the fire blocking material must completely enclose the cushion foam core material.

\(3\) Each specimen tested must be fabricated using the principal components (i.e., foam core, flotation material, fire blocking material, if used, and dress covering) and assembly processes (representative seams and closures) intended for use in the production articles. If a different material combination is used for the back cushion than for the bottom cushion, both material combinations must be tested as complete specimen sets, each set consisting of a back cushion specimen and a bottom cushion specimen. If a cushion, including outer dress covering, is demonstrated to meet the requirements of this appendix using the oil burner test, the dress covering of that cushion may be replaced with a similar dress covering provided the burn length of the replacement covering, as determined by the test specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.853   Compartment interiors.\|§25.853]](c), does not exceed the corresponding burn length of the dress covering used on the cushion subjected to the oil burner test.

\(4\) For at least two-thirds of the total number of specimen sets tested, the burn length from the burner must not reach the side of the cushion opposite the burner. The burn length must not exceed 17 inches. Burn length is the perpendicular distance from the inside edge of the seat frame closest to the burner to the farthest evidence of damage to the test specimen due to flame impingement, including areas of partial or complete consumption, charring, or embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, warped, or discolored, or areas where material has shrunk or melted away from the heat source.

\(5\) The average percentage weight loss must not exceed 10 percent. Also, at least two-thirds of the total number of specimen sets tested must not exceed 10 percent weight loss. All droppings falling from the cushions and mounting stand are to be discarded before the after-test weight is determined. The percentage weight loss for a specimen set is the weight of the specimen set before testing less the weight of the specimen set after testing expressed as the percentage of the weight before testing.

\(b\) *Test Conditions.* Vertical air velocity should average 25 fpm±10 fpm at the top of the back seat cushion. Horizontal air velocity should be below 10 fpm just above the bottom seat cushion. Air velocities should be measured with the ventilation hood operating and the burner motor off.

\(c\) *Test Specimens.* (1) For each test, one set of cushion specimens representing a seat bottom and seat back cushion must be used.

\(2\) The seat bottom cushion specimen must be 18 ± 1⁄8 inches (457 ±3 mm) wide by 20 ± 1⁄8 inches (508 ±3 mm) deep by 4 ± 1⁄8 inches (102 ±3 mm) thick, exclusive of fabric closures and seam overlap.

\(3\) The seat back cushion specimen must be 18 ± 1⁄8 inches (432 ±3 mm) wide by 25 ± 1⁄8 inches (635 ±3 mm) high by 2 ± 1⁄8 inches (51 ±3 mm) thick, exclusive of fabric closures and seam overlap.

\(d\) *Test Apparatus.* The arrangement of the test apparatus is shown in Figures 1 through 5 and must include the components described in this section. Minor details of the apparatus may vary, depending on the model burner used.

\(1\) *Specimen Mounting Stand.* The mounting stand for the test specimens consists of steel angles, as shown in Figure 1. The length of the mounting stand legs is 12 ± 1⁄8 inches (305 ±3 mm). The mounting stand must be used for mounting the test specimen seat bottom and seat back, as shown in Figure 2. The mounting stand should also include a suitable drip pan lined with aluminum foil, dull side up.

\(2\) *Test Burner.* The burner to be used in testing must—

\(i\) Be a modified gun type;

\(ii\) Have an 80-degree spray angle nozzle nominally rated for 2.25 gallons/hour at 100 psi;

\(iii\) Have a 12-inch (305 mm) burner cone installed at the end of the draft tube, with an opening 6 inches (152 mm) high and 11 inches (280 mm) wide, as shown in Figure 3; and

\(iv\) Have a burner fuel pressure regulator that is adjusted to deliver a nominal 2.0 gallon/hour of \# 2 Grade kerosene or equivalent required for the test.

\(3\) *Calorimeter.*

\(i\) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a (0-15.0 BTU/ft2-sec. 0-17.0 W/cm2) calorimeter, accurate ±3%, mounted in a 6-inch by 12-inch (152 by 305 mm) by 3⁄4 -inch (19 mm) thick calcium silicate insulating board which is attached to a steel angle bracket for placement in the test stand during burner calibration, as shown in Figure 4.

\(ii\) Because crumbling of the insulating board with service can result in misalignment of the calorimeter, the calorimeter must be monitored and the mounting shimmed, as necessary, to ensure that the calorimeter face is flush with the exposed plane of the insulating board in a plane parallel to the exit of the test burner cone.

\(4\) *Thermocouples.* The seven thermocouples to be used for testing must be 1⁄16 - to 1⁄8 -inch metal sheathed, ceramic packed, type K, grounded thermocouples with a nominal 22 to 30 American wire gage (AWG)-size conductor. The seven thermocouples must be attached to a steel angle bracket to form a thermocouple rake for placement in the test stand during burner calibration, as shown in Figure 5.

\(5\) *Apparatus Arrangement.* The test burner must be mounted on a suitable stand to position the exit of the burner cone a distance of 4 ± 1⁄8 inches (102 ±3 mm) from one side of the specimen mounting stand. The burner stand should have the capability of allowing the burner to be swung away from the specimen mounting stand during warmup periods.

\(6\) *Data Recording.* A recording potentiometer or other suitable calibrated instrument with an appropriate range must be used to measure and record the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouples.

\(7\) *Weight Scale.* Weighing Device—A device must be used that with proper procedures may determine the before and after test weights of each set of seat cushion specimens within 0.02 pound (9 grams). A continuous weighing system is preferred.

\(8\) *Timing Device.* A stopwatch or other device (calibrated to ±1 second) must be used to measure the time of application of the burner flame and self-extinguishing time or test duration.

\(e\) *Preparation of Apparatus.* Before calibration, all equipment must be turned on and the burner fuel must be adjusted as specified in paragraph (d)(2).

\(f\) *Calibration.* To ensure the proper thermal output of the burner, the following test must be made:

\(1\) Place the calorimeter on the test stand as shown in Figure 4 at a distance of 4 ± 1⁄8 inches (102 ±3 mm) from the exit of the burner cone.

\(2\) Turn on the burner, allow it to run for 2 minutes for warmup, and adjust the burner air intake damper to produce a reading of 10.5 ±0.5 BTU/ft2-sec. (11.9 ±0.6 w/cm2) on the calorimeter to ensure steady state conditions have been achieved. Turn off the burner.

\(3\) Replace the calorimeter with the thermocouple rake (Figure 5).

\(4\) Turn on the burner and ensure that the thermocouples are reading 1900 ±100 °F (1038 ±38 °C) to ensure steady state conditions have been achieved.

\(5\) If the calorimeter and thermocouples do not read within range, repeat steps in paragraphs 1 through 4 and adjust the burner air intake damper until the proper readings are obtained. The thermocouple rake and the calorimeter should be used frequently to maintain and record calibrated test parameters. Until the specific apparatus has demonstrated consistency, each test should be calibrated. After consistency has been confirmed, several tests may be conducted with the pre-test calibration before and a calibration check after the series.

\(g\) *Test Procedure.* The flammability of each set of specimens must be tested as follows:

\(1\) Record the weight of each set of seat bottom and seat back cushion specimens to be tested to the nearest 0.02 pound (9 grams).

\(2\) Mount the seat bottom and seat back cushion test specimens on the test stand as shown in Figure 2, securing the seat back cushion specimen to the test stand at the top.

\(3\) Swing the burner into position and ensure that the distance from the exit of the burner cone to the side of the seat bottom cushion specimen is 4 ± 1⁄8 inches (102 ±3 mm).

\(4\) Swing the burner away from the test position. Turn on the burner and allow it to run for 2 minutes to provide adequate warmup of the burner cone and flame stabilization.

\(5\) To begin the test, swing the burner into the test position and simultaneously start the timing device.

\(6\) Expose the seat bottom cushion specimen to the burner flame for 2 minutes and then turn off the burner. Immediately swing the burner away from the test position. Terminate test 7 minutes after initiating cushion exposure to the flame by use of a gaseous extinguishing agent (i.e., Halon or CO2).

\(7\) Determine the weight of the remains of the seat cushion specimen set left on the mounting stand to the nearest 0.02 pound (9 grams) excluding all droppings.

\(h\) *Test Report.* With respect to all specimen sets tested for a particular seat cushion for which testing of compliance is performed, the following information must be recorded:

\(1\) An identification and description of the specimens being tested.

\(2\) The number of specimen sets tested.

\(3\) The initial weight and residual weight of each set, the calculated percentage weight loss of each set, and the calculated average percentage weight loss for the total number of sets tested.

\(4\) The burn length for each set tested.

\(b\) *Summary of Method.* This method provides a laboratory test procedure for measuring the capability of cargo compartment lining materials to resist flame penetration with a 2 gallon per hour (GPH) \#2 Grade kerosene or equivalent burner fire source. Ceiling and sidewall liner panels may be tested individually provided a baffle is used to simulate the missing panel. Any specimen that passes the test as a ceiling liner panel may be used as a sidewall liner panel.

\(1\) *Specimen Mounting Stand.* The mounting stand for the test specimens consists of steel angles as shown in Figure 1.

\(2\) *Test Burner.* The burner to be used in tesing must—

\(i\) Be a modified gun type.

\(ii\) Use a suitable nozzle and maintain fuel pressure to yield a 2 GPH fuel flow. For example: an 80 degree nozzle nominally rated at 2.25 GPH and operated at 85 pounds per square inch (PSI) gage to deliver 2.03 GPH.

\(iii\) Have a 12 inch (305 mm) burner extension installed at the end of the draft tube with an opening 6 inches (152 mm) high and 11 inches (280 mm) wide as shown in Figure 3 of Part II of this appendix.

\(iv\) Have a burner fuel pressure regulator that is adjusted to deliver a nominal 2.0 GPH of \#2 Grade kerosene or equivalent.

\(3\) *Calorimeter.* (i) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a total heat flux Foil Type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range (approximately 0 to 15.0 British thermal unit (BTU) per ft.2 sec., 0-17.0 watts/cm2). The calorimeter must be mounted in a 6 inch by 12 inch (152 by 305 mm) by 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) thick insulating block which is attached to a steel angle bracket for placement in the test stand during burner calibration as shown in Figure 2 of this part of this appendix.

\(7\) *Timing Device.* A stopwatch or other device must be used to measure the time of flame application and the time of flame penetration, if it occurs.

\(e\) *Preparation of Apparatus.* Before calibration, all equipment must be turned on and allowed to stabilize, and the burner fuel flow must be adjusted as specified in paragraph (d)(2).

\(f\) *Calibration.* To ensure the proper thermal output of the burner the following test must be made:

\(1\) Remove the burner extension from the end of the draft tube. Turn on the blower portion of the burner without turning the fuel or igniters on. Measure the air velocity using a hot wire anemometer in the center of the draft tube across the face of the opening. Adjust the damper such that the air velocity is in the range of 1550 to 1800 ft./min. If tabs are being used at the exit of the draft tube, they must be removed prior to this measurement. Reinstall the draft tube extension cone.

\(2\) Place the calorimeter on the test stand as shown in Figure 2 at a distance of 8 inches (203 mm) from the exit of the burner cone to simulate the position of the horizontal test specimen.

\(3\) Turn on the burner, allow it to run for 2 minutes for warm-up, and adjust the damper to produce a calorimeter reading of 8.0 ±0.5 BTU per ft.2 sec. (9.1 ±0.6 Watts/cm2).

### Part IV—Test Method To Determine the Heat Release Rate From Cabin Materials Exposed to Radiant Heat.

\(a\) *Summary of Method.* Three or more specimens representing the completed aircraft component are tested. Each test specimen is injected into an environmental chamber through which a constant flow of air passes. The specimen's exposure is determined by a radiant heat source adjusted to produce, on the specimen, the desired total heat flux of 3.5 W/cm2. The specimen is tested with the exposed surface vertical. Combustion is initiated by piloted ignition. The combustion products leaving the chamber are monitored in order to calculate the release rate of heat.

\(b\) *Apparatus.* The Ohio State University (OSU) rate of heat release apparatus, as described below, is used. This is a modified version of the rate of heat release apparatus standardized by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), ASTM E-906.

\(1\) This apparatus is shown in Figures 1A and 1B of this part IV. All exterior surfaces of the apparatus, except the holding chamber, must be insulated with 1 inch (25 mm) thick, low density, high temperature, fiberglass board insulation. A gasketed door, through which the sample injection rod slides, must be used to form an airtight closure on the specimen hold chamber.

\(2\) *Thermopile.* The temperature difference between the air entering the environmental chamber and that leaving must be monitored by a thermopile having five hot, and five cold, 24-guage Chromel-Alumel junctions. The hot junctions must be spaced across the top of the exhaust stack, .38 inches (10 mm) below the top of the chimney. The thermocouples must have a .050 ±.010 inch (1.3 ±.3mm) diameter, ball-type, welded tip. One thermocouple must be located in the geometric center, with the other four located 1.18 inch (30 mm) from the center along the diagonal toward each of the corners (Figure 5 of this part IV). The cold junctions must be located in the pan below the lower air distribution plate (see paragraph (b)(4) of this part IV). Thermopile hot junctions must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to maintain the calibrated sensitivity.

\(3\) *Radiation Source.* A radiant heat source incorporating four Type LL silicon carbide elements, 20 inches (508 mm) long by .63 inch (16 mm) O.D., must be used, as shown in Figures 2A and 2B of this part IV. The heat source must have a nominal resistance of 1.4 ohms and be capable of generating a flux up to 100 kW/m2. The silicone carbide elements must be mounted in the stainless steel panel box by inserting them through .63 inch (16 mm) holes in .03 inch (1 mm) thick ceramic fiber or calcium-silicate millboard. Locations of the holes in the pads and stainless steel cover plates are shown in Figure 2B of this part IV. The truncated diamond-shaped mask of .042 ±.002 inch (1.07 ±.05mm) stainless steel must be added to provide uniform heat flux density over the area occupied by the vertical sample.

\(4\) *Air Distribution System.* The air entering the environmental chamber must be distributed by a .25 inch (6.3 mm) thick aluminum plate having eight No. 4 drill-holes, located 2 inches (51 mm) from sides on 4 inch (102 mm) centers, mounted at the base of the environmental chamber. A second plate of 18 guage stainless steel having 120, evenly spaced, No. 28 drill holes must be mounted 6 inches (152 mm) above the aluminum plate. A well-regulated air supply is required. The air-supply manifold at the base of the pyramidal section must have 48, evenly spaced, No. 26 drill holes located .38 inch (10 mm) from the inner edge of the manifold, resulting in an airflow split of approximately three to one within the apparatus.

\(5\) *Exhaust Stack.* An exhaust stack, 5.25 × 2.75 inches (133 × 70 mm) in cross section, and 10 inches (254 mm) long, fabricated from 28 guage stainless steel must be mounted on the outlet of the pyramidal section. A. 1.0 × 3.0 inch (25 × 76 mm) baffle plate of .018 ±.002 inch (.50 ±.05 mm) stainless steel must be centered inside the stack, perpendicular to the air flow, 3 inches (76 mm) above the base of the stack.

\(6\) *Specimen Holders.* (i) The specimen must be tested in a vertical orientation. The specimen holder (Figure 3 of this part IV) must incorporate a frame that touches the specimen (which is wrapped with aluminum foil as required by paragraph (d)(3) of this Part) along only the .25 inch (6 mm) perimeter. A “V” shaped spring is used to hold the assembly together. A detachable .50 × 50 × 5.91 inch (12 × 12 × 150 mm) drip pan and two .020 inch (.5 mm) stainless steel wires (as shown in Figure 3 of this part IV) must be used for testing materials prone to melting and dripping. The positioning of the spring and frame may be changed to accommodate different specimen thicknesses by inserting the retaining rod in different holes on the specimen holder.

\(ii\) Since the radiation shield described in ASTM E-906 is not used, a guide pin must be added to the injection mechanism. This fits into a slotted metal plate on the injection mechanism outside of the holding chamber. It can be used to provide accurate positioning of the specimen face after injection. The front surface of the specimen must be 3.9 inches (100 mm) from the closed radiation doors after injection.

\(iii\) The specimen holder clips onto the mounted bracket (Figure 3 of this part IV). The mounting bracket must be attached to the injection rod by three screws that pass through a wide-area washer welded onto a 1⁄2 -inch (13 mm) nut. The end of the injection rod must be threaded to screw into the nut, and a .020 inch (5.1 mm) thick wide area washer must be held between two 1⁄2 -inch (13 mm) nuts that are adjusted to tightly cover the hole in the radiation doors through which the injection rod or calibration calorimeter pass.

\(7\) *Calorimeter.* A total-flux type calorimeter must be mounted in the center of a 1⁄2 -inch Kaowool “M” board inserted in the sample holder to measure the total heat flux. The calorimeter must have a view angle of 180 degrees and be calibrated for incident flux. The calorimeter calibration must be acceptable to the Administrator.

\(8\) *Pilot-Flame Positions.* Pilot ignition of the specimen must be accomplished by simultaneously exposing the specimen to a lower pilot burner and an upper pilot burner, as described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) and (b)(8)(ii) or (b)(8)(iii) of this part IV, respectively. Since intermittent pilot flame extinguishment for more than 3 seconds would invalidate the test results, a spark ignitor may be installed to ensure that the lower pilot burner remains lighted.

\(i\) *Lower Pilot Burner.* The pilot-flame tubing must be .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8mm) wall, stainless steel tubing. A mixture of 120 cm3/min. of methane and 850 cm3/min. of air must be fed to the lower pilot flame burner. The normal position of the end of the pilot burner tubing is .40 inch (10 mm) from and perpendicular to the exposed vertical surface of the specimen. The centerline at the outlet of the burner tubing must intersect the vertical centerline of the sample at a point .20 inch (5 mm) above the lower exposed edge of the specimen.

\(ii\) *Standard Three-Hole Upper Pilot Burner.* The pilot burner must be a straight length of .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, stainless steel tubing that is 14 inches (360 mm) long. One end of the tubing must be closed, and three No. 40 drill holes must be drilled into the tubing, 2.38 inch (60 mm) apart, for gas ports, all radiating in the same direction. The first hole must be .19 inch (5 mm) from the closed end of the tubing. The tube must be positioned .75 inch (19 mm) above and .75 inch (19 mm) behind the exposed upper edge of the specimen. The middle hole must be in the vertical plane perpendicular to the exposed surface of the specimen which passes through its vertical centerline and must be pointed toward the radiation source. The gas supplied to the burner must be methane and must be adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm).

\(iii\) *Optional Fourteen-Hole Upper Pilot Burner.* This burner may be used in lieu of the standard three-hole burner described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this part IV. The pilot burner must be a straight length of .25 inch (6.3 mm) O.D., .03 inch (0.8 mm) wall, stainless steel tubing that is 15.75 inches (400 mm) long. One end of the tubing must be closed, and 14 No. 59 drill holes must be drilled into the tubing, .50 inch (13 mm) apart, for gas ports, all radiating in the same direction. The first hole must be .50 inch (13 mm) from the closed end of the tubing. The tube must be positioned above the specimen holder so that the holes are placed above the specimen as shown in Figure 1B of this part IV. The fuel supplied to the burner must be methane mixed with air in a ratio of approximately 50/50 by volume. The total gas flow must be adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm). When the gas/air ratio and the flow rate are properly adjusted, approximately .25 inch (6 mm) of the flame length appears yellow in color.

\(c\) *Calibration of Equipment*—(1) *Heat Release Rate.* A calibration burner, as shown in Figure 4, must be placed over the end of the lower pilot flame tubing using a gas tight connection. The flow of gas to the pilot flame must be at least 99 percent methane and must be accurately metered. Prior to usage, the wet test meter must be properly leveled and filled with distilled water to the tip of the internal pointer while no gas is flowing. Ambient temperature and pressure of the water are based on the internal wet test meter temperature. A baseline flow rate of approximately 1 liter/min. must be set and increased to higher preset flows of 4, 6, 8, 6 and 4 liters/min. Immediately prior to recording methane flow rates, a flow rate of 8 liters/min. must be used for 2 minutes to precondition the chamber. This is not recorded as part of calibration. The rate must be determined by using a stopwatch to time a complete revolution of the wet test meter for both the baseline and higher flow, with the flow returned to baseline before changing to the next higher flow. The thermopile baseline voltage must be measured. The gas flow to the burner must be increased to the higher preset flow and allowed to burn for 2.0 minutes, and the thermopile voltage must be measured. The sequence must be repeated until all five values have been determined. The average of the five values must be used as the calibration factor. The procedure must be repeated if the percent relative standard deviation is greater than 5 percent. Calculations are shown in paragraph (f) of this part IV.

\(2\) *Flux Uniformity.* Uniformity of flux over the specimen must be checked periodically and after each heating element change to determine if it is within acceptable limits of plus or minus 5 percent.

\(3\) As noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this part IV, thermopile hot junctions must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to maintain the calibrated sensitivity.

\(d\) *Preparation of Test Specimens.* (1) The test specimens must be representative of the aircraft component in regard to materials and construction methods. The standard size for the test specimens is 5.91 ±.03 × 5.91 ±.03 inches (149 ±1 × 149 ±1 mm). The thickness of the specimen must be the same as that of the aircraft component it represents up to a maximum thickness of 1.75 inches (45 mm). Test specimens representing thicker components must be 1.75 inches (45 mm).

\(2\) *Conditioning.* Specimens must be conditioned as described in Part 1 of this appendix.

\(3\) *Mounting.* Each test specimen must be wrapped tightly on all sides of the specimen, except for the one surface that is exposed with a single layer of .001 inch (.025 mm) aluminum foil.

\(e\) *Procedure.* (1) The power supply to the radiant panel must be set to produce a radiant flux of 3.5 ±.05 W/cm2, as measured at the point the center of the specimen surface will occupy when positioned for the test. The radiant flux must be measured after the air flow through the equipment is adjusted to the desired rate.

\(2\) After the pilot flames are lighted, their position must be checked as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this part IV.

\(3\) Air flow through the apparatus must be controlled by a circular plate orifice located in a 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) I.D. pipe with two pressure measuring points, located 1.5 inches (38 mm) upstream and .75 inches (19 mm) downstream of the orifice plate. The pipe must be connected to a manometer set at a pressure differential of 7.87 inches (200 mm) of Hg. (See Figure 1B of this part IV.) The total air flow to the equipment is approximately .04 m3/seconds. The stop on the vertical specimen holder rod must be adjusted so that the exposed surface of the specimen is positioned 3.9 inches (100 mm) from the entrance when injected into the environmental chamber.

\(4\) The specimen must be placed in the hold chamber with the radiation doors closed. The airtight outer door must be secured, and the recording devices must be started. The specimen must be retained in the hold chamber for 60 seconds, plus or minus 10 seconds, before injection. The thermopile “zero” value must be determined during the last 20 seconds of the hold period. The sample must not be injected before completion of the “zero” value determination.

\(5\) When the specimen is to be injected, the radiation doors must be opened. After the specimen is injected into the environmental chamber, the radiation doors must be closed behind the specimen.

\(6\) \[Reserved\]

\(7\) Injection of the specimen and closure of the inner door marks time zero. A record of the thermopile output with at least one data point per second must be made during the time the specimen is in the environmental chamber.

\(8\) The test duration is five minutes. The lower pilot burner and the upper pilot burner must remain lighted for the entire duration of the test, except that there may be intermittent flame extinguishment for periods that do not exceed 3 seconds. Furthermore, if the optional three-hole upper burner is used, at least two flamelets must remain lighted for the entire duration of the test, except that there may be intermittent flame extinguishment of all three flamelets for periods that do not exceed 3 seconds.

\(9\) A minimum of three specimens must be tested.

\(f\) *Calculations.* (1) The calibration factor is calculated as follows:

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.072.pdf)

F0 = flow of methane at baseline (1pm)

F1 = higher preset flow of methane (1pm)

V0 = thermopile voltage at baseline (mv)

V1 = thermopile voltage at higher flow (mv)

Ta = Ambient temperature (K)

P = Ambient pressure (mm Hg)

Pv = Water vapor pressure (mm Hg)

\(2\) Heat release rates may be calculated from the reading of the thermopile output voltage at any instant of time as:

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er02fe95.006.pdf)

HRR = heat release rate (kw/m2)

Vb = baseline voltage (mv)

Vm = measured thermopile voltage (mv)

Kh = calibration factor (kw/mv)

\(3\) The integral of the heat release rate is the total heat release as a function of time and is calculated by multiplying the rate by the data sampling frequency in minutes and summing the time from zero to two minutes.

\(g\) *Criteria.* The total positive heat release over the first two minutes of exposure for each of the three or more samples tested must be averaged, and the peak heat release rate for each of the samples must be averaged. The average total heat release must not exceed 65 kilowatt-minutes per square meter, and the average peak heat release rate must not exceed 65 kilowatts per square meter.

\(h\) *Report.* The test report must include the following for each specimen tested:

\(1\) Description of the specimen.

\(2\) Radiant heat flux to the specimen, expressed in W/cm2.

\(3\) Data giving release rates of heat (in kW/m2) as a function of time, either graphically or tabulated at intervals no greater than 10 seconds. The calibration factor (kn) must be recorded.

\(4\) If melting, sagging, delaminating, or other behavior that affects the exposed surface area or the mode of burning occurs, these behaviors must be reported, together with the time at which such behaviors were observed.

\(5\) The peak heat release and the 2-minute integrated heat release rate must be reported.

### Part V. Test Method To Determine the Smoke Emission Characteristics of Cabin Materials

\(a\) *Summary of Method.* The specimens must be constructed, conditioned, and tested in the flaming mode in accordance with American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Test Method ASTM F814-83.

\(b\) *Acceptance Criteria.* The specific optical smoke density (Ds), which is obtained by averaging the reading obtained after 4 minutes with each of the three specimens, shall not exceed 200.

### Part VI—Test Method To Determine the Flammability and Flame Propagation Characteristics of Thermal/Acoustic Insulation Materials

Use this test method to evaluate the flammability and flame propagation characteristics of thermal/acoustic insulation when exposed to both a radiant heat source and a flame.

\(a\) *Definitions.*

“Flame propagation” means the furthest distance of the propagation of visible flame towards the far end of the test specimen, measured from the midpoint of the ignition source flame. Measure this distance after initially applying the ignition source and before all flame on the test specimen is extinguished. The measurement is not a determination of burn length made after the test.

“Radiant heat source” means an electric or air propane panel.

“Thermal/acoustic insulation” means a material or system of materials used to provide thermal and/or acoustic protection. Examples include fiberglass or other batting material encapsulated by a film covering and foams.

“Zero point” means the point of application of the pilot burner to the test specimen.

\(b\) *Test apparatus.*

\(1\) *Radiant panel test chamber.* Conduct tests in a radiant panel test chamber (see figure 1 above). Place the test chamber under an exhaust hood to facilitate clearing the chamber of smoke after each test. The radiant panel test chamber must be an enclosure 55 inches (1397 mm) long by 19.5 (495 mm) deep by 28 (710 mm) to 30 inches (maximum) (762 mm) above the test specimen. Insulate the sides, ends, and top with a fibrous ceramic insulation, such as Kaowool MTM board. On the front side, provide a 52 by 12-inch (1321 by 305 mm) draft-free, high-temperature, glass window for viewing the sample during testing. Place a door below the window to provide access to the movable specimen platform holder. The bottom of the test chamber must be a sliding steel platform that has provision for securing the test specimen holder in a fixed and level position. The chamber must have an internal chimney with exterior dimensions of 5.1 inches (129 mm) wide, by 16.2 inches (411 mm) deep by 13 inches (330 mm) high at the opposite end of the chamber from the radiant energy source. The interior dimensions must be 4.5 inches (114 mm) wide by 15.6 inches (395 mm) deep. The chimney must extend to the top of the chamber (see figure 2).

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.004.pdf)

\(2\) *Radiant heat source.* Mount the radiant heat energy source in a cast iron frame or equivalent. An electric panel must have six, 3-inch wide emitter strips. The emitter strips must be perpendicular to the length of the panel. The panel must have a radiation surface of 127⁄8 by 181⁄2 inches (327 by 470 mm). The panel must be capable of operating at temperatures up to 1300 °F (704 °C). An air propane panel must be made of a porous refractory material and have a radiation surface of 12 by 18 inches (305 by 457 mm). The panel must be capable of operating at temperatures up to 1,500 °F (816 °C). *See* figures 3a and 3b.

\(i\) *Electric radiant panel.* The radiant panel must be 3-phase and operate at 208 volts. A single-phase, 240 volt panel is also acceptable. Use a solid-state power controller and microprocessor-based controller to set the electric panel operating parameters.

\(ii\) *Gas radiant panel.* Use propane (liquid petroleum gas—2.1 UN 1075) for the radiant panel fuel. The panel fuel system must consist of a venturi-type aspirator for mixing gas and air at approximately atmospheric pressure. Provide suitable instrumentation for monitoring and controlling the flow of fuel and air to the panel. Include an air flow gauge, an air flow regulator, and a gas pressure gauge.

\(iii\) *Radiant panel placement.* Mount the panel in the chamber at 30° to the horizontal specimen plane, and 71⁄2 inches above the zero point of the specimen.

\(3\) *Specimen holding system.* (i) The sliding platform serves as the housing for test specimen placement. Brackets may be attached (via wing nuts) to the top lip of the platform in order to accommodate various thicknesses of test specimens. Place the test specimens on a sheet of Kaowool MTM board or 1260 Standard Board (manufactured by Thermal Ceramics and available in Europe), or equivalent, either resting on the bottom lip of the sliding platform or on the base of the brackets. It may be necessary to use multiple sheets of material based on the thickness of the test specimen (to meet the sample height requirement). Typically, these non-combustible sheets of material are available in 1⁄4 inch (6 mm) thicknesses. See figure 4. A sliding platform that is deeper than the 2-inch (50.8mm) platform shown in figure 4 is also acceptable as long as the sample height requirement is met.

![eCFR graphic er31jy03.007.gif](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/er31jy03.007.gif)

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.007.pdf)

\(ii\) Attach a 1⁄2 inch (13 mm) piece of Kaowool MTM board or other high temperature material measuring 411⁄2 by 81⁄4 inches (1054 by 210 mm) to the back of the platform. This board serves as a heat retainer and protects the test specimen from excessive preheating. The height of this board must not impede the sliding platform movement (in and out of the test chamber). If the platform has been fabricated such that the back side of the platform is high enough to prevent excess preheating of the specimen when the sliding platform is out, a retainer board is not necessary.

\(iii\) Place the test specimen horizontally on the non-combustible board(s). Place a steel retaining/securing frame fabricated of mild steel, having a thickness of 1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) and overall dimensions of 23 by 131⁄8 inches (584 by 333 mm) with a specimen opening of 19 by 103⁄4 inches (483 by 273 mm) over the test specimen. The front, back, and right portions of the top flange of the frame must rest on the top of the sliding platform, and the bottom flanges must pinch all 4 sides of the test specimen. The right bottom flange must be flush with the sliding platform. See figure 5.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.008.pdf)

\(4\) *Pilot Burner.* The pilot burner used to ignite the specimen must be a BernzomaticTM commercial propane venturi torch with an axially symmetric burner tip and a propane supply tube with an orifice diameter of 0.006 inches (0.15 mm). The length of the burner tube must be 27⁄8 inches (71 mm). The propane flow must be adjusted via gas pressure through an in-line regulator to produce a blue inner cone length of 3⁄4 inch (19 mm). A 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) guide (such as a thin strip of metal) may be soldered to the top of the burner to aid in setting the flame height. The overall flame length must be approximately 5 inches long (127 mm). Provide a way to move the burner out of the ignition position so that the flame is horizontal and at least 2 inches (50 mm) above the specimen plane. See figure 6.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.009.pdf)

\(5\) *Thermocouples.* Install a 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG) Type K (Chromel-Alumel) thermocouple in the test chamber for temperature monitoring. Insert it into the chamber through a small hole drilled through the back of the chamber. Place the thermocouple so that it extends 11 inches (279 mm) out from the back of the chamber wall, 111⁄2 inches (292 mm) from the right side of the chamber wall, and is 2 inches (51 mm) below the radiant panel. The use of other thermocouples is optional.

\(6\) *Calorimeter.* The calorimeter must be a one-inch cylindrical water-cooled, total heat flux density, foil type Gardon Gage that has a range of 0 to 5 BTU/ft2-second (0 to 5.7 Watts/cm2).

\(7\) *Calorimeter calibration specification and procedure.*

\(i\) *Calorimeter specification.*

\(A\) Foil diameter must be 0.25 ±0.005 inches (6.35 ±0.13 mm).

\(B\) Foil thickness must be 0.0005 ±0.0001 inches (0.013 ±0.0025 mm).

\(C\) Foil material must be thermocouple grade Constantan.

\(D\) Temperature measurement must be a Copper Constantan thermocouple.

\(E\) The copper center wire diameter must be 0.0005 inches (0.013 mm).

\(F\) The entire face of the calorimeter must be lightly coated with “Black Velvet” paint having an emissivity of 96 or greater.

\(ii\) *Calorimeter calibration.* (A) The calibration method must be by comparison to a like standardized transducer.

\(B\) The standardized transducer must meet the specifications given in paragraph VI(b)(6) of this appendix.

\(C\) Calibrate the standard transducer against a primary standard traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

\(D\) The method of transfer must be a heated graphite plate.

\(E\) The graphite plate must be electrically heated, have a clear surface area on each side of the plate of at least 2 by 2 inches (51 by 51 mm), and be 1⁄8 inch ± 1⁄16 inch thick (3.2 ±1.6 mm).

\(F\) Center the 2 transducers on opposite sides of the plates at equal distances from the plate.

\(G\) The distance of the calorimeter to the plate must be no less than 0.0625 inches (1.6 mm), nor greater than 0.375 inches (9.5 mm).

\(H\) The range used in calibration must be at least 0-3.5 BTUs/ft2 second (0-3.9 Watts/cm2) and no greater than 0-5.7 BTUs/ft2 second (0-6.4 Watts/cm2).

\(I\) The recording device used must record the 2 transducers simultaneously or at least within 1⁄10 of each other.

\(8\) *Calorimeter fixture.* With the sliding platform pulled out of the chamber, install the calorimeter holding frame and place a sheet of non-combustible material in the bottom of the sliding platform adjacent to the holding frame. This will prevent heat losses during calibration. The frame must be 131⁄8 inches (333 mm) deep (front to back) by 8 inches (203 mm) wide and must rest on the top of the sliding platform. It must be fabricated of 1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) flat stock steel and have an opening that accommodates a 1⁄2 inch (12.7 mm) thick piece of refractory board, which is level with the top of the sliding platform. The board must have three 1-inch (25.4 mm) diameter holes drilled through the board for calorimeter insertion. The distance to the radiant panel surface from the centerline of the first hole (“zero” position) must be 71⁄2 ± 1⁄8 inches (191 ±3 mm). The distance between the centerline of the first hole to the centerline of the second hole must be 2 inches (51 mm). It must also be the same distance from the centerline of the second hole to the centerline of the third hole. *See* figure 7. A calorimeter holding frame that differs in construction is acceptable as long as the height from the centerline of the first hole to the radiant panel and the distance between holes is the same as described in this paragraph.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.010.pdf)

\(9\) *Instrumentation.* Provide a calibrated recording device with an appropriate range or a computerized data acquisition system to measure and record the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouple. The data acquisition system must be capable of recording the calorimeter output every second during calibration.

\(10\) *Timing device.* Provide a stopwatch or other device, accurate to ±1 second/hour, to measure the time of application of the pilot burner flame.

\(c\) *Test specimens.* (1) *Specimen preparation.* Prepare and test a minimum of three test specimens. If an oriented film cover material is used, prepare and test both the warp and fill directions.

\(2\) *Construction.* Test specimens must include all materials used in construction of the insulation (including batting, film, scrim, tape etc.). Cut a piece of core material such as foam or fiberglass, and cut a piece of film cover material (if used) large enough to cover the core material. Heat sealing is the preferred method of preparing fiberglass samples, since they can be made without compressing the fiberglass (“box sample”). Cover materials that are not heat sealable may be stapled, sewn, or taped as long as the cover material is over-cut enough to be drawn down the sides without compressing the core material. The fastening means should be as continuous as possible along the length of the seams. The specimen thickness must be of the same thickness as installed in the airplane.

\(3\) *Specimen Dimensions.* To facilitate proper placement of specimens in the sliding platform housing, cut non-rigid core materials, such as fiberglass, 121⁄2 inches (318mm) wide by 23 inches (584mm) long. Cut rigid materials, such as foam, 111⁄2 ± 1⁄4 inches (292 mm ±6mm) wide by 23 inches (584mm) long in order to fit properly in the sliding platform housing and provide a flat, exposed surface equal to the opening in the housing.

\(d\) *Specimen conditioning.* Condition the test specimens at 70 ±5 °F (21 ±2 °C) and 55% ±10% relative humidity, for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing.

\(e\) *Apparatus Calibration.* (1) With the sliding platform out of the chamber, install the calorimeter holding frame. Push the platform back into the chamber and insert the calorimeter into the first hole (“zero” position). *See* figure 7. Close the bottom door located below the sliding platform. The distance from the centerline of the calorimeter to the radiant panel surface at this point must be 7. 1⁄2 inches ± 1⁄8 (191 mm ±3). Prior to igniting the radiant panel, ensure that the calorimeter face is clean and that there is water running through the calorimeter.

\(2\) Ignite the panel. Adjust the fuel/air mixture to achieve 1.5 BTUs/ft2-second ±5% (1.7 Watts/cm2 ±5%) at the “zero” position. If using an electric panel, set the power controller to achieve the proper heat flux. Allow the unit to reach steady state (this may take up to 1 hour). The pilot burner must be off and in the down position during this time.

\(3\) After steady-state conditions have been reached, move the calorimeter 2 inches (51 mm) from the “zero” position (first hole) to position 1 and record the heat flux. Move the calorimeter to position 2 and record the heat flux. Allow enough time at each position for the calorimeter to stabilize. Table 1 depicts typical calibration values at the three positions.

\(4\) Open the bottom door, remove the calorimeter and holder fixture. Use caution as the fixture is very hot.

\(f\) *Test Procedure.* (1) Ignite the pilot burner. Ensure that it is at least 2 inches (51 mm) above the top of the platform. The burner must not contact the specimen until the test begins.

\(2\) Place the test specimen in the sliding platform holder. Ensure that the test sample surface is level with the top of the platform. At “zero” point, the specimen surface must be 71⁄2 inches ± 1⁄8 inch (191 mm ±3) below the radiant panel.

\(3\) Place the retaining/securing frame over the test specimen. It may be necessary (due to compression) to adjust the sample (up or down) in order to maintain the distance from the sample to the radiant panel (71⁄2 inches ± 1⁄8 inch (191 mm±3) at “zero” position). With film/fiberglass assemblies, it is critical to make a slit in the film cover to purge any air inside. This allows the operator to maintain the proper test specimen position (level with the top of the platform) and to allow ventilation of gases during testing. A longitudinal slit, approximately 2 inches (51mm) in length, must be centered 3 inches ± 1⁄2 inch (76mm±13mm) from the left flange of the securing frame. A utility knife is acceptable for slitting the film cover.

\(4\) Immediately push the sliding platform into the chamber and close the bottom door.

\(5\) Bring the pilot burner flame into contact with the center of the specimen at the “zero” point and simultaneously start the timer. The pilot burner must be at a 27° angle with the sample and be approximately 1⁄2 inch (12 mm) above the sample. *See* figure 7. A stop, as shown in figure 8, allows the operator to position the burner correctly each time.

\(6\) Leave the burner in position for 15 seconds and then remove to a position at least 2 inches (51 mm) above the specimen.

\(g\) Report. (1) Identify and describe the test specimen.

\(2\) Report any shrinkage or melting of the test specimen.

\(3\) Report the flame propagation distance. If this distance is less than 2 inches, report this as a pass (no measurement required).

\(4\) Report the after-flame time.

\(h\) *Requirements.* (1) There must be no flame propagation beyond 2 inches (51 mm) to the left of the centerline of the pilot flame application.

\(2\) The flame time after removal of the pilot burner may not exceed 3 seconds on any specimen.

### Part VII—Test Method To Determine the Burnthrough Resistance of Thermal/Acoustic Insulation Materials

Use the following test method to evaluate the burnthrough resistance characteristics of aircraft thermal/acoustic insulation materials when exposed to a high intensity open flame.

\(a\) *Definitions.*

*Burnthrough time* means the time, in seconds, for the burner flame to penetrate the test specimen, and/or the time required for the heat flux to reach 2.0 Btu/ft2sec (2.27 W/cm2) on the inboard side, at a distance of 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the front surface of the insulation blanket test frame, whichever is sooner. The burnthrough time is measured at the inboard side of each of the insulation blanket specimens.

*Insulation blanket specimen* means one of two specimens positioned in either side of the test rig, at an angle of 30° with respect to vertical.

*Specimen set* means two insulation blanket specimens. Both specimens must represent the same production insulation blanket construction and materials, proportioned to correspond to the specimen size.

\(b\) *Apparatus.* (1) The arrangement of the test apparatus is shown in figures 1 and 2 and must include the capability of swinging the burner away from the test specimen during warm-up.

\(2\) *Test burner.* The test burner must be a modified gun-type such as the Park Model DPL 3400. Flame characteristics are highly dependent on actual burner setup. Parameters such as fuel pressure, nozzle depth, stator position, and intake airflow must be properly adjusted to achieve the correct flame output.

\(i\) *Nozzle.* A nozzle must maintain the fuel pressure to yield a nominal 6.0 gal/hr (0.378 L/min) fuel flow. A Monarch-manufactured 80° PL (hollow cone) nozzle nominally rated at 6.0 gal/hr at 100 lb/in2 (0.71 MPa) delivers a proper spray pattern.

\(ii\) *Fuel Rail.* The fuel rail must be adjusted to position the fuel nozzle at a depth of 0.3125 inch (8 mm) from the end plane of the exit stator, which must be mounted in the end of the draft tube.

\(iii\) *Internal Stator.* The internal stator, located in the middle of the draft tube, must be positioned at a depth of 3.75 inches (95 mm) from the tip of the fuel nozzle. The stator must also be positioned such that the integral igniters are located at an angle midway between the 10 and 11 o'clock position, when viewed looking into the draft tube. Minor deviations to the igniter angle are acceptable if the temperature and heat flux requirements conform to the requirements of paragraph VII(e) of this appendix.

\(iv\) *Blower Fan.* The cylindrical blower fan used to pump air through the burner must measure 5.25 inches (133 mm) in diameter by 3.5 inches (89 mm) in width.

\(v\) *Burner cone.* Install a 12 + 0.125-inch (305 ±3 mm) burner extension cone at the end of the draft tube. The cone must have an opening 6 ±0.125-inch (152 ±3 mm) high and 11 ±0.125-inch (280 ±3 mm) wide (see figure 3).

\(vi\) *Fuel.* Use JP-8, Jet A, or their international equivalent, at a flow rate of 6.0 ±0.2 gal/hr (0.378 ±0.0126 L/min). If this fuel is unavailable, ASTM K2 fuel (Number 2 grade kerosene) or ASTM D2 fuel (Number 2 grade fuel oil or Number 2 diesel fuel) are acceptable if the nominal fuel flow rate, temperature, and heat flux measurements conform to the requirements of paragraph VII(e) of this appendix.

\(vii\) *Fuel pressure regulator.* Provide a fuel pressure regulator, adjusted to deliver a nominal 6.0 gal/hr (0.378 L/min) flow rate. An operating fuel pressure of 100 lb/in2 (0.71 MPa) for a nominally rated 6.0 gal/hr 80° spray angle nozzle (such as a PL type) delivers 6.0 ±0.2 gal/hr (0.378 ±0.0126 L/min).

\(3\) *Calibration rig and equipment.* (i) Construct individual calibration rigs to incorporate a calorimeter and thermocouple rake for the measurement of heat flux and temperature. Position the calibration rigs to allow movement of the burner from the test rig position to either the heat flux or temperature position with minimal difficulty.

\(ii\) *Calorimeter.* The calorimeter must be a total heat flux, foil type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range such as 0-20 Btu/ft2-sec (0-22.7 W/cm2), accurate to ±3% of the indicated reading. The heat flux calibration method must be in accordance with paragraph VI(b)(7) of this appendix.

\(iii\) *Calorimeter mounting.* Mount the calorimeter in a 6- by 12- ±0.125 inch (152- by 305- ±3 mm) by 0.75 ±0.125 inch (19 mm ±3 mm) thick insulating block which is attached to the heat flux calibration rig during calibration (figure 4). Monitor the insulating block for deterioration and replace it when necessary. Adjust the mounting as necessary to ensure that the calorimeter face is parallel to the exit plane of the test burner cone.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.016.pdf)

\(iv\) *Thermocouples.* Provide seven 1⁄8 -inch (3.2 mm) ceramic packed, metal sheathed, type K (Chromel-alumel), grounded junction thermocouples with a nominal 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG) size conductor for calibration. Attach the thermocouples to a steel angle bracket to form a thermocouple rake for placement in the calibration rig during burner calibration (figure 5).

\(v\) *Air velocity meter.* Use a vane-type air velocity meter to calibrate the velocity of air entering the burner. An Omega Engineering Model HH30A is satisfactory. Use a suitable adapter to attach the measuring device to the inlet side of the burner to prevent air from entering the burner other than through the measuring device, which would produce erroneously low readings. Use a flexible duct, measuring 4 inches wide (102 mm) by 20 feet long (6.1 meters), to supply fresh air to the burner intake to prevent damage to the air velocity meter from ingested soot. An optional airbox permanently mounted to the burner intake area can effectively house the air velocity meter and provide a mounting port for the flexible intake duct.

\(4\) *Test specimen mounting frame.* Make the mounting frame for the test specimens of 1⁄8 -inch (3.2 mm) thick steel as shown in figure 1, except for the center vertical former, which should be 1⁄4 -inch (6.4 mm) thick to minimize warpage. The specimen mounting frame stringers (horizontal) should be bolted to the test frame formers (vertical) such that the expansion of the stringers will not cause the entire structure to warp. Use the mounting frame for mounting the two insulation blanket test specimens as shown in figure 2.

\(5\) *Backface calorimeters.* Mount two total heat flux Gardon type calorimeters behind the insulation test specimens on the back side (cold) area of the test specimen mounting frame as shown in figure 6. Position the calorimeters along the same plane as the burner cone centerline, at a distance of 4 inches (102 mm) from the vertical centerline of the test frame.

![eCFR graphic er31jy03.017.gif](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/er31jy03.017.gif)

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.017.pdf)

\(i\) The calorimeters must be a total heat flux, foil type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range such as 0-5 Btu/ft2-sec (0-5.7 W/cm2), accurate to ±3% of the indicated reading. The heat flux calibration method must comply with paragraph VI(b)(7) of this appendix.

\(6\) *Instrumentation.* Provide a recording potentiometer or other suitable calibrated instrument with an appropriate range to measure and record the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouples.

\(7\) *Timing device.* Provide a stopwatch or other device, accurate to ±1%, to measure the time of application of the burner flame and burnthrough time.

\(8\) *Test chamber.* Perform tests in a suitable chamber to reduce or eliminate the possibility of test fluctuation due to air movement. The chamber must have a minimum floor area of 10 by 10 feet (305 by 305 cm).

\(i\) *Ventilation hood.* Provide the test chamber with an exhaust system capable of removing the products of combustion expelled during tests.

\(c\) *Test Specimens.* (1) *Specimen preparation.* Prepare a minimum of three specimen sets of the same construction and configuration for testing.

\(2\) *Insulation blanket test specimen.*

\(i\) For batt-type materials such as fiberglass, the constructed, finished blanket specimen assemblies must be 32 inches wide by 36 inches long (81.3 by 91.4 cm), exclusive of heat sealed film edges.

\(ii\) For rigid and other non-conforming types of insulation materials, the finished test specimens must fit into the test rig in such a manner as to replicate the actual in-service installation.

\(3\) *Construction.* Make each of the specimens tested using the principal components (*i.e.,* insulation, fire barrier material if used, and moisture barrier film) and assembly processes (representative seams and closures).

\(i\) *Fire barrier material.* If the insulation blanket is constructed with a fire barrier material, place the fire barrier material in a manner reflective of the installed arrangement For example, if the material will be placed on the outboard side of the insulation material, inside the moisture film, place it the same way in the test specimen.

\(ii\) *Insulation material.* Blankets that utilize more than one variety of insulation (composition, density, etc.) must have specimen sets constructed that reflect the insulation combination used. If, however, several blanket types use similar insulation combinations, it is not necessary to test each combination if it is possible to bracket the various combinations.

\(iii\) *Moisture barrier film.* If a production blanket construction utilizes more than one type of moisture barrier film, perform separate tests on each combination. For example, if a polyimide film is used in conjunction with an insulation in order to enhance the burnthrough capabilities, also test the same insulation when used with a polyvinyl fluoride film.

\(iv\) *Installation on test frame.* Attach the blanket test specimens to the test frame using 12 steel spring type clamps as shown in figure 7. Use the clamps to hold the blankets in place in both of the outer vertical formers, as well as the center vertical former (4 clamps per former). The clamp surfaces should measure 1 inch by 2 inches (25 by 51 mm). Place the top and bottom clamps 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the top and bottom of the test frame, respectively. Place the middle clamps 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the top and bottom clamps.

![eCFR graphic er31jy03.018.gif](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/er31jy03.018.gif)

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.018.pdf)

(Note: For blanket materials that cannot be installed in accordance with figure 7 above, the blankets must be installed in a manner approved by the FAA.)

\(v\) *Conditioning.* Condition the specimens at 70° ±5 °F (21° ±2 °C) and 55% ±10% relative humidity for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing.

\(d\) *Preparation of apparatus.* (1) Level and center the frame assembly to ensure alignment of the calorimeter and/or thermocouple rake with the burner cone.

\(2\) Turn on the ventilation hood for the test chamber. Do not turn on the burner blower. Measure the airflow of the test chamber using a vane anemometer or equivalent measuring device. The vertical air velocity just behind the top of the upper insulation blanket test specimen must be 100 ±50 ft/min (0.51 ±0.25 m/s). The horizontal air velocity at this point must be less than 50 ft/min (0.25 m/s).

\(3\) If a calibrated flow meter is not available, measure the fuel flow rate using a graduated cylinder of appropriate size. Turn on the burner motor/fuel pump, after insuring that the igniter system is turned off. Collect the fuel via a plastic or rubber tube into the graduated cylinder for a 2-minute period. Determine the flow rate in gallons per hour. The fuel flow rate must be 6.0 ±0.2 gallons per hour (0.378 ±0.0126 L/min).

\(e\) *Calibration.* (1) Position the burner in front of the calorimeter so that it is centered and the vertical plane of the burner cone exit is 4 ±0.125 inches (102 ±3 mm) from the calorimeter face. Ensure that the horizontal centerline of the burner cone is offset 1 inch below the horizontal centerline of the calorimeter (figure 8). Without disturbing the calorimeter position, rotate the burner in front of the thermocouple rake, such that the middle thermocouple (number 4 of 7) is centered on the burner cone.

![eCFR graphic er31jy03.019.gif](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/er31jy03.019.gif)

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er31jy03.019.pdf)

Ensure that the horizontal centerline of the burner cone is also offset 1 inch below the horizontal centerline of the thermocouple tips. Re-check measurements by rotating the burner to each position to ensure proper alignment between the cone and the calorimeter and thermocouple rake. (Note: The test burner mounting system must incorporate “detents” that ensure proper centering of the burner cone with respect to both the calorimeter and the thermocouple rakes, so that rapid positioning of the burner can be achieved during the calibration procedure.)

\(2\) Position the air velocity meter in the adapter or airbox, making certain that no gaps exist where air could leak around the air velocity measuring device. Turn on the blower/motor while ensuring that the fuel solenoid and igniters are off. Adjust the air intake velocity to a level of 2150 ft/min, (10.92 m/s) then turn off the blower/motor. (Note: The Omega HH30 air velocity meter measures 2.625 inches in diameter. To calculate the intake airflow, multiply the cross-sectional area (0.03758 ft2) by the air velocity (2150 ft/min) to obtain 80.80 ft3/min. An air velocity meter other than the HH30 unit can be used, provided the calculated airflow of 80.80 ft3/min (2.29 m3/min) is equivalent.)

\(3\) Rotate the burner from the test position to the warm-up position. Prior to lighting the burner, ensure that the calorimeter face is clean of soot deposits, and there is water running through the calorimeter. Examine and clean the burner cone of any evidence of buildup of products of combustion, soot, etc. Soot buildup inside the burner cone may affect the flame characteristics and cause calibration difficulties. Since the burner cone may distort with time, dimensions should be checked periodically.

\(4\) While the burner is still rotated to the warm-up position, turn on the blower/motor, igniters and fuel flow, and light the burner. Allow it to warm up for a period of 2 minutes. Move the burner into the calibration position and allow 1 minute for calorimeter stabilization, then record the heat flux once every second for a period of 30 seconds. Turn off burner, rotate out of position, and allow to cool. Calculate the average heat flux over this 30-second duration. The average heat flux should be 16.0 ±0.8 Btu/ft2 sec (18.2 ±0.9 W/cm2).

\(5\) Position the burner in front of the thermocouple rake. After checking for proper alignment, rotate the burner to the warm-up position, turn on the blower/motor, igniters and fuel flow, and light the burner. Allow it to warm up for a period of 2 minutes. Move the burner into the calibration position and allow 1 minute for thermocouple stabilization, then record the temperature of each of the 7 thermocouples once every second for a period of 30 seconds. Turn off burner, rotate out of position, and allow to cool. Calculate the average temperature of each thermocouple over this 30-second period and record. The average temperature of each of the 7 thermocouples should be 1900 °F ±100 °F (1038 ±56 °C).

\(6\) If either the heat flux or the temperatures are not within the specified range, adjust the burner intake air velocity and repeat the procedures of paragraphs (4) and (5) above to obtain the proper values. Ensure that the inlet air velocity is within the range of 2150 ft/min ±50 ft/min (10.92 ±0.25 m/s).

\(7\) Calibrate prior to each test until consistency has been demonstrated. After consistency has been confirmed, several tests may be conducted with calibration conducted before and after a series of tests.

\(f\) *Test procedure.* (1) Secure the two insulation blanket test specimens to the test frame. The insulation blankets should be attached to the test rig center vertical former using four spring clamps positioned as shown in figure 7 (according to the criteria of paragraph paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this part of this appendix).

\(2\) Ensure that the vertical plane of the burner cone is at a distance of 4 ±0.125 inch (102 ±3 mm) from the outer surface of the horizontal stringers of the test specimen frame, and that the burner and test frame are both situated at a 30° angle with respect to vertical.

\(3\) When ready to begin the test, direct the burner away from the test position to the warm-up position so that the flame will not impinge on the specimens prematurely. Turn on and light the burner and allow it to stabilize for 2 minutes.

\(4\) To begin the test, rotate the burner into the test position and simultaneously start the timing device.

\(5\) Expose the test specimens to the burner flame for 4 minutes and then turn off the burner. Immediately rotate the burner out of the test position.

\(6\) Determine (where applicable) the burnthrough time, or the point at which the heat flux exceeds 2.0 Btu/ft2-sec (2.27 W/cm2).

\(g\) *Report.* (1) Identify and describe the specimen being tested.

\(2\) Report the number of insulation blanket specimens tested.

\(3\) Report the burnthrough time (if any), and the maximum heat flux on the back face of the insulation blanket test specimen, and the time at which the maximum occurred.

\(h\) *Requirements.* (1) Each of the two insulation blanket test specimens must not allow fire or flame penetration in less than 4 minutes.

\(2\) Each of the two insulation blanket test specimens must not allow more than 2.0 Btu/ft2-sec (2.27 W/cm2) on the cold side of the insulation specimens at a point 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the face of the test rig.

### Appendix I to Part 25—Installation of an Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System (ATTCS)

I25.1   *General.*

\(a\) This appendix specifies additional requirements for installation of an engine power control system that automatically resets thrust or power on operating engine(s) in the event of any one engine failure during takeoff.

\(b\) With the ATTCS and associated systems functioning normally as designed, all applicable requirements of Part 25, except as provided in this appendix, must be met without requiring any action by the crew to increase thrust or power.

I25.2   *Definitions.*

\(a\) *Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System (ATTCS).* An ATTCS is defined as the entire automatic system used on takeoff, including all devices, both mechanical and electrical, that sense engine failure, transmit signals, actuate fuel controls or power levers or increase engine power by other means on operating engines to achieve scheduled thrust or power increases, and furnish cockpit information on system operation.

\(b\) *Critical Time Interval.* When conducting an ATTCS takeoff, the critical time interval is between V1 minus 1 second and a point on the minimum performance, all-engine flight path where, assuming a simultaneous occurrence of an engine and ATTCS failure, the resulting minimum flight path thereafter intersects the Part 25 required actual flight path at no less than 400 feet above the takeoff surface. This time interval is shown in the following illustration:

![eCFR graphic ec28se91.082.gif](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/ec28se91.082.gif)

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.082.pdf)

I25.3   *Performance and System Reliability Requirements.*

The applicant must comply with the performance and ATTCS reliability requirements as follows:

\(a\) An ATTCS failure or a combination of failures in the ATTCS during the critical time interval:

\(1\) Shall not prevent the insertion of the *maximum approved takeoff* thrust or power, or must be shown to be an improbable event.

\(2\) Shall not result in a significant loss or reduction in thrust or power, or must be shown to be an extremely improbable event.

\(b\) The concurrent existence of an ATTCS failure and an engine failure during the critical time interval must be shown to be extremely improbable.

\(c\) All applicable performance requirements of Part 25 must be met with an engine failure occurring at the most critical point during takeoff with the ATTCS system functioning.

I25.4   *Thrust Setting.*

The initial takeoff thrust or power setting on each engine at the beginning of the takeoff roll may not be less than any of the following:

\(a\) Ninety (90) percent of the thrust or power set by the ATTCS (the maximum takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane under existing ambient conditions);

\(b\) That required to permit normal operation of all safety-related systems and equipment dependent upon engine thrust or power lever position; or

\(c\) That shown to be free of hazardous engine response characteristics when thrust or power is advanced from the initial takeoff thrust or power to the maximum approved takeoff thrust or power.

I25.5   *Powerplant Controls.*

The applicant must identify, track and resolve any problems found during the validation in accordance with the problem tracking and resolution system specified in section K25.3.2(e) of this appendix.

\(b\) *New technology testing.* Technology new to the applicant, including substantially new manufacturing techniques, must be tested to substantiate its suitability for the airplane design.

\(c\) *APU validation test.* If an APU is needed to comply with this appendix, one APU of the type to be certified with the airplane must be tested for 3,000 equivalent airplane operational cycles. Following completion of the test, the APU must be disassembled and inspected. The applicant must identify, track, and resolve each cause or potential cause of an inability to start or operate the APU in flight as intended in accordance with the problem tracking and resolution system specified in section K25.3.2(e) of this appendix.

\(d\) *Airplane demonstration.* For each airplane-engine combination to be approved for ETOPS, the applicant must flight test at least one airplane to demonstrate that the airplane, and its components and equipment are capable of functioning properly during ETOPS flights and diversions of the longest duration for which the applicant seeks approval. This flight testing may be performed in conjunction with, but may not substitute for the flight testing required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0021 Certification procedures for products and articles#§21.35   Flight tests.\|§21.35]](b)(2).

\(1\) The airplane demonstration flight test program must include:

\(i\) Flights simulating actual ETOPS including flight at normal cruise altitude, step climbs, and, if applicable, APU operation.

\(ii\) Maximum duration flights with maximum duration diversions.

\(iii\) Maximum duration engine-inoperative diversions distributed among the engines installed on the airplanes used for the airplane demonstration flight test program. At least two one engine-inoperative diversions must be conducted at maximum continuous thrust or power using the same engine.

\(iv\) Flights under non-normal conditions to validate the flightcrew's ability to safely conduct an ETOPS diversion with worst-case ETOPS significant system failures or malfunctions that could occur in service.

\(v\) Diversions to airports that represent airports of the types used for ETOPS diversions.

\(vi\) Repeated exposure to humid and inclement weather on the ground followed by a long duration flight at normal cruise altitude.

\(2\) The airplane demonstration flight test program must validate the adequacy of the airplane's flying qualities and performance, and the flightcrew's ability to safely conduct an ETOPS diversion under the conditions specified in section K25.3.2(d)(1) of this appendix.

\(3\) During the airplane demonstration flight test program, each test airplane must be operated and maintained using the applicant's recommended operating and maintenance procedures.

\(4\) At the completion of the airplane demonstration, each ETOPS significant system must undergo an on-wing inspection or test in accordance with the tasks defined in the proposed Instructions for Continued Airworthiness to establish its condition for continued safe operation. Each engine must also undergo a gas path inspection. These inspections must be conducted in a manner to identify abnormal conditions that could result in an IFSD or diversion. The applicant must identify, track and resolve any abnormal conditions in accordance with the problem tracking and resolution system specified in section K25.3.2(e) of this appendix.

\(e\) *Problem tracking and resolution system.* (1) The applicant must establish and maintain a problem tracking and resolution system. The system must:

\(i\) Contain a process for prompt reporting to the FAA office responsible for the design approval of each occurrence reportable under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0021 Certification procedures for products and articles#§21.4   ETOPS reporting requirements.\|§21.4]](a)(6) encountered during the phases of airplane and engine development used to assess Early ETOPS eligibility.

\(ii\) Contain a process for notifying the FAA office responsible for the design approval of each proposed corrective action that the applicant determines necessary for each problem identified from the occurrences reported under section K25.3.2(h)(1)(i) of this appendix. The timing of the notification must permit appropriate FAA review before taking the proposed corrective action.

\(2\) If the applicant is seeking ETOPS type design approval of a change to an airplane-engine combination previously approved for ETOPS, the problem tracking and resolution system need only address those problems specified in the following table, provided the applicant obtains prior authorization from the FAA:

### Appendix M to Part 25—Fuel Tank System Flammability Reduction Means

M25.1   *Fuel tank flammability exposure requirements.*

\(a\) The Fleet Average Flammability Exposure of each fuel tank, as determined in accordance with Appendix N of this part, may not exceed 3 percent of the Flammability Exposure Evaluation Time (FEET), as defined in Appendix N of this part. As a portion of this 3 percent, if flammability reduction means (FRM) are used, each of the following time periods may not exceed 1.8 percent of the FEET:

\(1\) When any FRM is operational but the fuel tank is not inert and the tank is flammable; and

\(2\) When any FRM is inoperative and the tank is flammable.

\(b\) The Fleet Average Flammability Exposure, as defined in Appendix N of this part, of each fuel tank may not exceed 3 percent of the portion of the FEET occurring during either ground or takeoff/climb phases of flight during warm days. The analysis must consider the following conditions.

\(1\) The analysis must use the subset of those flights that begin with a sea level ground ambient temperature of 80 °F (standard day plus 21 °F atmosphere) or above, from the flammability exposure analysis done for overall performance.

\(2\) For the ground and takeoff/climb phases of flight, the average flammability exposure must be calculated by dividing the time during the specific flight phase the fuel tank is flammable by the total time of the specific flight phase.

\(3\) Compliance with this paragraph may be shown using only those flights for which the airplane is dispatched with the flammability reduction means operational.

M25.2   *Showing compliance.*

\(a\) The applicant must provide data from analysis, ground testing, and flight testing, or any combination of these, that:

\(1\) Validate the parameters used in the analysis required by paragraph M25.1 of this appendix;

\(2\) Substantiate that the FRM is effective at limiting flammability exposure in all compartments of each tank for which the FRM is used to show compliance with paragraph M25.1 of this appendix; and

\(3\) Describe the circumstances under which the FRM would not be operated during each phase of flight.

\(b\) The applicant must validate that the FRM meets the requirements of paragraph M25.1 of this appendix with any airplane or engine configuration affecting the performance of the FRM for which approval is sought.

M25.3   *Reliability indications and maintenance access.*

\(a\) Reliability indications must be provided to identify failures of the FRM that would otherwise be latent and whose identification is necessary to ensure the fuel tank with an FRM meets the fleet average flammability exposure requirements listed in paragraph M25.1 of this appendix, including when the FRM is inoperative.

\(b\) Sufficient accessibility to FRM reliability indications must be provided for maintenance personnel or the flightcrew.

\(c\) The access doors and panels to the fuel tanks with FRMs (including any tanks that communicate with a tank via a vent system), and to any other confined spaces or enclosed areas that could contain hazardous atmosphere under normal conditions or failure conditions, must be permanently stenciled, marked, or placarded to warn maintenance personnel of the possible presence of a potentially hazardous atmosphere.

M25.4   *Airworthiness limitations and procedures.*

\(a\) If FRM is used to comply with paragraph M25.1 of this appendix, Airworthiness Limitations must be identified for all maintenance or inspection tasks required to identify failures of components within the FRM that are needed to meet paragraph M25.1 of this appendix.

\(b\) Maintenance procedures must be developed to identify any hazards to be considered during maintenance of the FRM. These procedures must be included in the instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA).

M25.5   *Reliability reporting.*

The effects of airplane component failures on FRM reliability must be assessed on an on-going basis. The applicant/holder must do the following:

\(a\) Demonstrate effective means to ensure collection of FRM reliability data. The means must provide data affecting FRM reliability, such as component failures.

\(b\) Unless alternative reporting procedures are approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office, as defined in part 26 of this subchapter, provide a report to the FAA every six months for the first five years after service introduction. After that period, continued reporting every six months may be replaced with other reliability tracking methods found acceptable to the FAA or eliminated if it is established that the reliability of the FRM meets, and will continue to meet, the exposure requirements of paragraph M25.1 of this appendix.

\(c\) Develop service instructions or revise the applicable airplane manual, according to a schedule approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office, as defined in part 26 of this subchapter, to correct any failures of the FRM that occur in service that could increase any fuel tank's Fleet Average Flammability Exposure to more than that required by paragraph M25.1 of this appendix.

### Appendix N to Part 25—Fuel Tank Flammability Exposure and Reliability Analysis

N25.1   *General.*

\(a\) This appendix specifies the requirements for conducting fuel tank fleet average flammability exposure analyses required to meet [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.981   Fuel tank explosion prevention.\|§25.981]](b) and Appendix M of this part. For fuel tanks installed in aluminum wings, a qualitative assessment is sufficient if it substantiates that the tank is a conventional unheated wing tank.

\(b\) This appendix defines parameters affecting fuel tank flammability that must be used in performing the analysis. These include parameters that affect all airplanes within the fleet, such as a statistical distribution of ambient temperature, fuel flash point, flight lengths, and airplane descent rate. Demonstration of compliance also requires application of factors specific to the airplane model being evaluated. Factors that need to be included are maximum range, cruise mach number, typical altitude where the airplane begins initial cruise phase of flight, fuel temperature during both ground and flight times, and the performance of a flammability reduction means (FRM) if installed.

\(c\) The following definitions, input variables, and data tables must be used in the program to determine fleet average flammability exposure for a specific airplane model.

N25.2   *Definitions.*

\(a\) *Bulk Average Fuel Temperature* means the average fuel temperature within the fuel tank or different sections of the tank if the tank is subdivided by baffles or compartments.

\(b\) *Flammability Exposure Evaluation Time (FEET).* The time from the start of preparing the airplane for flight, through the flight and landing, until all payload is unloaded, and all passengers and crew have disembarked. In the Monte Carlo program, the flight time is randomly selected from the Flight Length Distribution (Table 2), the pre-flight times are provided as a function of the flight time, and the post-flight time is a constant 30 minutes.

\(c\) *Flammable.* With respect to a fluid or gas, flammable means susceptible to igniting readily or to exploding ([[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/A Definitions and general requirements/0001 Definitions and abbreviations\|14 CFR Part 1]], Definitions). A non-flammable ullage is one where the fuel-air vapor is too lean or too rich to burn or is inert as defined below. For the purposes of this appendix, a fuel tank that is not inert is considered flammable when the bulk average fuel temperature within the tank is within the flammable range for the fuel type being used. For any fuel tank that is subdivided into sections by baffles or compartments, the tank is considered flammable when the bulk average fuel temperature within any section of the tank, that is not inert, is within the flammable range for the fuel type being used.

\(d\) *Flash Point.* The flash point of a flammable fluid means the lowest temperature at which the application of a flame to a heated sample causes the vapor to ignite momentarily, or “flash.” Table 1 of this appendix provides the flash point for the standard fuel to be used in the analysis.

\(e\) *Fleet average flammability exposure* is the percentage of the flammability exposure evaluation time (FEET) each fuel tank ullage is flammable for a fleet of an airplane type operating over the range of flight lengths in a world-wide range of environmental conditions and fuel properties as defined in this appendix.

\(f\) *Gaussian Distribution* is another name for the normal distribution, a symmetrical frequency distribution having a precise mathematical formula relating the mean and standard deviation of the samples. Gaussian distributions yield bell-shaped frequency curves having a preponderance of values around the mean with progressively fewer observations as the curve extends outward.

\(g\) *Hazardous atmosphere.* An atmosphere that may expose maintenance personnel, passengers or flight crew to the risk of death, incapacitation, impairment of ability to self-rescue (that is, escape unaided from a confined space), injury, or acute illness.

\(h\) *Inert.* For the purpose of this appendix, the tank is considered inert when the bulk average oxygen concentration within each compartment of the tank is 12 percent or less from sea level up to 10,000 feet altitude, then linearly increasing from 12 percent at 10,000 feet to 14.5 percent at 40,000 feet altitude, and extrapolated linearly above that altitude.

\(i\) *Inerting.* A process where a noncombustible gas is introduced into the ullage of a fuel tank so that the ullage becomes non-flammable.

\(j\) *Monte Carlo Analysis.* The analytical method that is specified in this appendix as the compliance means for assessing the fleet average flammability exposure time for a fuel tank.

\(k\) *Oxygen evolution* occurs when oxygen dissolved in the fuel is released into the ullage as the pressure and temperature in the fuel tank are reduced.

\(l\) *Standard deviation* is a statistical measure of the dispersion or variation in a distribution, equal to the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic means.

\(m\) *Transport Effects.* For purposes of this appendix, transport effects are the change in fuel vapor concentration in a fuel tank caused by low fuel conditions and fuel condensation and vaporization.

\(n\) *Ullage.* The volume within the fuel tank not occupied by liquid fuel.

N25.3   *Fuel tank flammability exposure analysis.*

\(a\) A flammability exposure analysis must be conducted for the fuel tank under evaluation to determine fleet average flammability exposure for the airplane and fuel types under evaluation. For fuel tanks that are subdivided by baffles or compartments, an analysis must be performed either for each section of the tank, or for the section of the tank having the highest flammability exposure. Consideration of transport effects is not allowed in the analysis. The analysis must be done in accordance with the methods and procedures set forth in the Fuel Tank Flammability Assessment Method User's Manual, dated May 2008, document number DOT/FAA/AR-05/8 (incorporated by reference, see [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.5   Incorporations by reference.\|§25.5]]). The parameters specified in sections N25.3(b) and (c) of this appendix must be used in the fuel tank flammability exposure “Monte Carlo” analysis.

\(b\) The following parameters are defined in the Monte Carlo analysis and provided in paragraph N25.4 of this appendix:

\(1\) Cruise Ambient Temperature, as defined in this appendix.

\(2\) Ground Ambient Temperature, as defined in this appendix.

\(3\) Fuel Flash Point, as defined in this appendix.

\(4\) Flight Length Distribution, as defined in Table 2 of this appendix.

\(5\) Airplane Climb and Descent Profiles, as defined in the Fuel Tank Flammability Assessment Method User's Manual, dated May 2008, document number DOT/FAA/AR-05/8 (incorporated by reference in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.5   Incorporations by reference.\|§25.5]]).

\(c\) Parameters that are specific to the particular airplane model under evaluation that must be provided as inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis are:

\(1\) Airplane cruise altitude.

\(2\) Fuel tank quantities. If fuel quantity affects fuel tank flammability, inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis must be provided that represent the actual fuel quantity within the fuel tank or compartment of the fuel tank throughout each of the flights being evaluated. Input values for this data must be obtained from ground and flight test data or the approved FAA fuel management procedures.

\(3\) Airplane cruise mach number.

\(4\) Airplane maximum range.

\(5\) Fuel tank thermal characteristics. If fuel temperature affects fuel tank flammability, inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis must be provided that represent the actual bulk average fuel temperature within the fuel tank at each point in time throughout each of the flights being evaluated. For fuel tanks that are subdivided by baffles or compartments, bulk average fuel temperature inputs must be provided for each section of the tank. Input values for these data must be obtained from ground and flight test data or a thermal model of the tank that has been validated by ground and flight test data.

\(6\) Maximum airplane operating temperature limit, as defined by any limitations in the airplane flight manual.

\(7\) Airplane Utilization. The applicant must provide data supporting the number of flights per day and the number of hours per flight for the specific airplane model under evaluation. If there is no existing airplane fleet data to support the airplane being evaluated, the applicant must provide substantiation that the number of flights per day and the number of hours per flight for that airplane model is consistent with the existing fleet data they propose to use.

\(d\) *Fuel Tank FRM Model.* If FRM is used, an FAA approved Monte Carlo program must be used to show compliance with the flammability requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.981   Fuel tank explosion prevention.\|§25.981]] and Appendix M of this part. The program must determine the time periods during each flight phase when the fuel tank or compartment with the FRM would be flammable. The following factors must be considered in establishing these time periods:

\(1\) Any time periods throughout the flammability exposure evaluation time and under the full range of expected operating conditions, when the FRM is operating properly but fails to maintain a non-flammable fuel tank because of the effects of the fuel tank vent system or other causes,

\(2\) If dispatch with the system inoperative under the Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) is requested, the time period assumed in the reliability analysis (60 flight hours must be used for a 10-day MMEL dispatch limit unless an alternative period has been approved by the Administrator),

\(3\) Frequency and duration of time periods of FRM inoperability, substantiated by test or analysis acceptable to the FAA, caused by latent or known failures, including airplane system shut-downs and failures that could cause the FRM to shut down or become inoperative.

\(4\) Effects of failures of the FRM that could increase the flammability exposure of the fuel tank.

\(5\) If an FRM is used that is affected by oxygen concentrations in the fuel tank, the time periods when oxygen evolution from the fuel results in the fuel tank or compartment exceeding the inert level. The applicant must include any times when oxygen evolution from the fuel in the tank or compartment under evaluation would result in a flammable fuel tank. The oxygen evolution rate that must be used is defined in the Fuel Tank Flammability Assessment Method User's Manual, dated May 2008, document number DOT/FAA/AR-05/8 (incorporated by reference in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.5   Incorporations by reference.\|§25.5]]).

\(6\) If an inerting system FRM is used, the effects of any air that may enter the fuel tank following the last flight of the day due to changes in ambient temperature, as defined in Table 4, during a 12-hour overnight period.

\(e\) The applicant must submit to the responsible Aircraft Certification Service officefor approval the fuel tank flammability analysis, including the airplane-specific parameters identified under paragraph N25.3(c) of this appendix and any deviations from the parameters identified in paragraph N25.3(b) of this appendix that affect flammability exposure, substantiating data, and any airworthiness limitations and other conditions assumed in the analysis.

N25.4   *Variables and data tables.*

The following data must be used when conducting a flammability exposure analysis to determine the fleet average flammability exposure. Variables used to calculate fleet flammability exposure must include atmospheric ambient temperatures, flight length, flammability exposure evaluation time, fuel flash point, thermal characteristics of the fuel tank, overnight temperature drop, and oxygen evolution from the fuel into the ullage.

\(a\) Atmospheric Ambient Temperatures and Fuel Properties.

\(1\) In order to predict flammability exposure during a given flight, the variation of ground ambient temperatures, cruise ambient temperatures, and a method to compute the transition from ground to cruise and back again must be used. The variation of the ground and cruise ambient temperatures and the flash point of the fuel is defined by a Gaussian curve, given by the 50 percent value and a ±1-standard deviation value.

\(2\) Ambient Temperature: Under the program, the ground and cruise ambient temperatures are linked by a set of assumptions on the atmosphere. The temperature varies with altitude following the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) rate of change from the ground ambient temperature until the cruise temperature for the flight is reached. Above this altitude, the ambient temperature is fixed at the cruise ambient temperature. This results in a variation in the upper atmospheric temperature. For cold days, an inversion is applied up to 10,000 feet, and then the ISA rate of change is used.

\(3\) Fuel properties:

\(i\) For Jet A fuel, the variation of flash point of the fuel is defined by a Gaussian curve, given by the 50 percent value and a ±1-standard deviation, as shown in Table 1 of this appendix.

\(ii\) The flammability envelope of the fuel that must be used for the flammability exposure analysis is a function of the flash point of the fuel selected by the Monte Carlo for a given flight. The flammability envelope for the fuel is defined by the upper flammability limit (UFL) and lower flammability limit (LFL) as follows:

\(A\) LFL at sea level = flash point temperature of the fuel at sea level minus 10 °F. LFL decreases from sea level value with increasing altitude at a rate of 1 °F per 808 feet.

\(B\) UFL at sea level = flash point temperature of the fuel at sea level plus 63.5 °F. UFL decreases from the sea level value with increasing altitude at a rate of 1 °F per 512 feet.

\(4\) For each flight analyzed, a separate random number must be generated for each of the three parameters (ground ambient temperature, cruise ambient temperature, and fuel flash point) using the Gaussian distribution defined in Table 1 of this appendix.

### Appendix O to Part 25—Supercooled Large Drop Icing Conditions

This Appendix consists of two parts. Part I defines this Appendix as a description of supercooled large drop icing conditions in which the drop median volume diameter (MVD) is less than or greater than 40 µm, the maximum mean effective drop diameter (MED) of Appendix C of this part continuous maximum (stratiform clouds) icing conditions. For this Appendix, supercooled large drop icing conditions consist of freezing drizzle and freezing rain occurring in and/or below stratiform clouds. Part II defines ice accretions used to show compliance with the airplane performance and handling qualities requirements of subpart B of this part.

# PART I—METEOROLOGY

In this Appendix icing conditions are defined by the parameters of altitude, vertical and horizontal extent, temperature, liquid water content, and water mass distribution as a function of drop diameter distribution.

\(a\) Freezing Drizzle (Conditions with spectra maximum drop diameters from 100µm to 500 µm):

\(1\) Pressure altitude range: 0 to 22,000 feet MSL.

\(2\) Maximum vertical extent: 12,000 feet.

\(3\) Horizontal extent: Standard distance of 17.4 nautical miles.

\(4\) Total liquid water content.

<div>

Note: Liquid water content (LWC) in grams per cubic meter (g/m3) based on horizontal extent standard distance of 17.4 nautical miles.

</div>

\(5\) Drop diameter distribution: Figure 2.

\(6\) Altitude and temperature envelope: Figure 3.

\(b\) Freezing Rain (Conditions with spectra maximum drop diameters greater than 500 µm):

\(1\) Pressure altitude range: 0 to 12,000 ft MSL.

\(2\) Maximum vertical extent: 7,000 ft.

\(3\) Horizontal extent: Standard distance of 17.4 nautical miles.

\(4\) Total liquid water content.

Note: LWC in grams per cubic meter (g/m3) based on horizontal extent standard distance of 17.4 nautical miles.

\(5\) Drop Diameter Distribution: Figure 5.

\(6\) Altitude and temperature envelope: Figure 6.

\(c\) Horizontal extent.

The liquid water content for freezing drizzle and freezing rain conditions for horizontal extents other than the standard 17.4 nautical miles can be determined by the value of the liquid water content determined from Figure 1 or Figure 4, multiplied by the factor provided in Figure 7, which is defined by the following equation:

S = 1.266 − 0.213 log10(H)

S = Liquid Water Content Scale Factor (dimensionless) and

H = horizontal extent in nautical miles

\(5\) *Approach ice* is the ice accretion on the unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, resulting from the more critical of the:

\(i\) Ice accumulated in the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix during a descent from the maximum vertical extent of the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix, to 2,000 feet above the landing surface in the cruise configuration, plus transition to the approach configuration and flying for 15 minutes at 2,000 feet above the landing surface; or

\(ii\) Holding ice as defined by part II, paragraph (c)(4), of this Appendix.

\(6\) *Landing ice* is the ice accretion on the unprotected surfaces, and any ice accretion on the protected surfaces appropriate to normal ice protection system operation, resulting from the more critical of the:

\(i\) Ice accretion defined by part II, paragraph (c)(5)(i), of this Appendix, plus ice accumulated in the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix during a descent from 2,000 feet above the landing surface to a height of 200 feet above the landing surface with a transition to the landing configuration, followed by a go-around at the minimum climb gradient required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.119   Landing climb: All-engines-operating.\|§25.119]], from a height of 200 feet above the landing surface to 2,000 feet above the landing surface, flying for 15 minutes at 2,000 feet above the landing surface in the approach configuration, and a descent to the landing surface (touchdown) in the landing configuration; or

\(ii\) Holding ice as defined by part II, paragraph (c)(4), of this Appendix.

\(7\) For both unprotected and protected parts, the ice accretion for the takeoff phase must be determined for the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix, using the following assumptions:

\(i\) The airfoils, control surfaces, and, if applicable, propellers are free from frost, snow, or ice at the start of takeoff;

\(ii\) The ice accretion starts at the end of the takeoff distance;

\(iii\) The critical ratio of thrust/power-to-weight;

\(iv\) Failure of the critical engine occurs at VEF; and

\(v\) Crew activation of the ice protection system is in accordance with a normal operating procedure provided in the airplane flight manual, except that after beginning the takeoff roll, it must be assumed that the crew takes no action to activate the ice protection system until the airplane is at least 400 feet above the takeoff surface.

\(d\) The ice accretion before the ice protection system has been activated and is performing its intended function is the critical ice accretion formed on the unprotected and normally protected surfaces before activation and effective operation of the ice protection system in the icing conditions defined in part I of this Appendix. This ice accretion only applies in showing compliance to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.143   General.\|§§25.143]](j) and 25.207(h).

\(e\) In order to reduce the number of ice accretions to be considered when demonstrating compliance with the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes#§25.21   Proof of compliance.\|§25.21]](g), any of the ice accretions defined in this Appendix may be used for any other flight phase if it is shown to be at least as critical as the specific ice accretion defined for that flight phase. Configuration differences and their effects on ice accretions must be taken into account.

\(f\) The ice accretion that has the most adverse effect on handling qualities may be used for airplane performance tests provided any difference in performance is conservatively taken into account.

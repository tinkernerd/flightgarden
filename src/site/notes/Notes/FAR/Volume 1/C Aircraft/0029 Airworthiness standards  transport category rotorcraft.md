## Subpart B—Flight

### General

### §29.21   Proof of compliance.

Each requirement of this subpart must be met at each appropriate combination of weight and center of gravity within the range of loading conditions for which certification is requested. This must be shown—

\(a\) By tests upon a rotorcraft of the type for which certification is requested, or by calculations based on, and equal in accuracy to, the results of testing; and

\(b\) By systematic investigation of each required combination of weight and center of gravity, if compliance cannot be reasonably inferred from combinations investigated.

\[Doc. No. 5084, 29 FR 16150. Dec. 3, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 29-15, 43 FR 2326, Jan. 16, 1978\]

### §29.31   Removable ballast.

Removable ballast may be used in showing compliance with the flight requirements of this subpart.

### §29.33   Main rotor speed and pitch limits.

\(a\) *Main rotor speed limits.* A range of main rotor speeds must be established that—

\(1\) With power on, provides adequate margin to accommodate the variations in rotor speed occurring in any appropriate maneuver, and is consistent with the kind of governor or synchronizer used; and

\(2\) With power off, allows each appropriate autorotative maneuver to be performed throughout the ranges of airspeed and weight for which certification is requested.

\(b\) *Normal main rotor high pitch limit (power on).* For rotorcraft, except helicopters required to have a main rotor low speed warning under paragraph (e) of this section, it must be shown, with power on and without exceeding approved engine maximum limitations, that main rotor speeds substantially less than the minimum approved main rotor speed will not occur under any sustained flight condition. This must be met by—

\(1\) Appropriate setting of the main rotor high pitch stop;

\(2\) Inherent rotorcraft characteristics that make unsafe low main rotor speeds unlikely; or

\(3\) Adequate means to warn the pilot of unsafe main rotor speeds.

\(c\) *Normal main rotor low pitch limit (power off).* It must be shown, with power off, that—

\(1\) The normal main rotor low pitch limit provides sufficient rotor speed, in any autorotative condition, under the most critical combinations of weight and airspeed; and

\(2\) It is possible to prevent overspeeding of the rotor without exceptional piloting skill.

\(d\) *Emergency high pitch.* If the main rotor high pitch stop is set to meet paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and if that stop cannot be exceeded inadvertently, additional pitch may be made available for emergency use.

\(e\) *Main rotor low speed warning for helicopters.* For each single engine helicopter, and each multiengine helicopter that does not have an approved device that automatically increases power on the operating engines when one engine fails, there must be a main rotor low speed warning which meets the following requirements:

\(1\) The warning must be furnished to the pilot in all flight conditions, including power-on and power-off flight, when the speed of a main rotor approaches a value that can jeopardize safe flight.

\(2\) The warning may be furnished either through the inherent aerodynamic qualities of the helicopter or by a device.

\(3\) The warning must be clear and distinct under all conditions, and must be clearly distinguishable from all other warnings. A visual device that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself.

\(4\) If a warning device is used, the device must automatically deactivate and reset when the low-speed condition is corrected. If the device has an audible warning, it must also be equipped with a means for the pilot to manually silence the audible warning before the low-speed condition is corrected.

(Secs. 313(a), 601, 603, 604, and 605 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421, 1423, 1424, and 1425); and sec. 6(c) of the Dept. of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1655(c)))

\(1\) The control stops only;

\(2\) The control locks only;

\(3\) The irreversible mechanism only (with the mechanism locked and with the control surface in the critical positions for the effective parts of the system within its limit of motion);

\(4\) The attachment of the control system to the rotor blade pitch control horn only (with the control in the critical positions for the affected parts of the system within the limits of its motion); and

\(2\) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3) of this section, when power-operated actuator controls or power boost controls are used, the system must also withstand the loads resulting from the limit pilot forces prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.397   Limit pilot forces and torques.\|§29.397]] in conjunction with the forces output of each normally energized power device, including any single power boost or actuator system failure;

The minimum design loads must, in any case, provide a rugged system for service use, including consideration of fatigue, jamming, ground gusts, control inertia, and friction loads. In the absence of a rational analysis, the design loads resulting from 0.60 of the specified limit pilot forces are acceptable minimum design loads; and

\(c\) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces are supported by the vertical tail surfaces, the vertical tail surfaces and supporting structure must be designed for the combined vertical and horizontal surface loads resulting from each prescribed flight condition, considered separately. The flight conditions must be selected so that the maximum design loads are obtained on each surface. In the absence of more rational data, the unsymmetrical horizontal tail surface loading distributions described in this section must be assumed.

### §29.563   Structural ditching provisions.

If certification with ditching provisions is requested, structural strength for ditching must meet the requirements of this section and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.801   Ditching.\|§29.801]](e).

\(a\) *Forward speed landing conditions.* The rotorcraft must initially contact the most critical wave for reasonably probable water conditions at forward velocities from zero up to 30 knots in likely pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes. The rotorcraft limit vertical descent velocity may not be less than 5 feet per second relative to the mean water surface. Rotor lift may be used to act through the center of gravity throughout the landing impact. This lift may not exceed two-thirds of the design maximum weight. A maximum forward velocity of less than 30 knots may be used in design if it can be demonstrated that the forward velocity selected would not be exceeded in a normal one-engine-out touchdown.

\(b\) *Auxiliary or emergency float conditions*—(1) *Floats fixed or deployed before initial water contact.* In addition to the landing loads in paragraph (a) of this section, each auxiliary or emergency float, or its support and attaching structure in the airframe or fuselage, must be designed for the load developed by a fully immersed float unless it can be shown that full immersion is unlikely. If full immersion is unlikely, the highest likely float buoyancy load must be applied. The highest likely buoyancy load must include consideration of a partially immersed float creating restoring moments to compensate the upsetting moments caused by side wind, unsymmetrical rotorcraft loading, water wave action, rotorcraft inertia, and probable structural damage and leakage considered under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.801   Ditching.\|§29.801]](d). Maximum roll and pitch angles determined from compliance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.801   Ditching.\|§29.801]](d) may be used, if significant, to determine the extent of immersion of each float. If the floats are deployed in flight, appropriate air loads derived from the flight limitations with the floats deployed shall be used in substantiation of the floats and their attachment to the rotorcraft. For this purpose, the design airspeed for limit load is the float deployed airspeed operating limit multiplied by 1.11.

\(2\) *Floats deployed after initial water contact.* Each float must be designed for full or partial immersion prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, each float must be designed for combined vertical and drag loads using a relative limit speed of 20 knots between the rotorcraft and the water. The vertical load may not be less than the highest likely buoyancy load determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

### Fatigue Evaluation

### §29.571   Fatigue Tolerance Evaluation of Metallic Structure.

\(a\) A fatigue tolerance evaluation of each principal structural element (PSE) must be performed, and appropriate inspections and retirement time or approved equivalent means must be established to avoid catastrophic failure during the operational life of the rotorcraft. The fatigue tolerance evaluation must consider the effects of both fatigue and the damage determined under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Parts to be evaluated include PSEs of the rotors, rotor drive systems between the engines and rotor hubs, controls, fuselage, fixed and movable control surfaces, engine and transmission mountings, landing gear, and their related primary attachments.

\(b\) For the purposes of this section, the term—

\(1\) *Catastrophic failure* means an event that could prevent continued safe flight and landing.

\(2\) *Principal structural element (PSE)* means a structural element that contributes significantly to the carriage of flight or ground loads, and the fatigue failure of that structural element could result in catastrophic failure of the aircraft.

\(c\) The methodology used to establish compliance with this section must be submitted to and approved by the Administrator.

\(d\) Considering all rotorcraft structure, structural elements, and assemblies, each PSE must be identified.

\(e\) Each fatigue tolerance evaluation required by this section must include:

\(1\) In-flight measurements to determine the fatigue loads or stresses for the PSEs identified in paragraph (d) of this section in all critical conditions throughout the range of design limitations required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.309   Design limitations.\|§29.309]] (including altitude effects), except that maneuvering load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in operations.

\(2\) The loading spectra as severe as those expected in operations based on loads or stresses determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, including external load operations, if applicable, and other high frequency power-cycle operations.

\(3\) Takeoff, landing, and taxi loads when evaluating the landing gear and other affected PSEs.

\(4\) For each PSE identified in paragraph (d) of this section, a threat assessment which includes a determination of the probable locations, types, and sizes of damage, taking into account fatigue, environmental effects, intrinsic and discrete flaws, or accidental damage that may occur during manufacture or operation.

\(5\) A determination of the fatigue tolerance characteristics for the PSE with the damage identified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section that supports the inspection and retirement times, or other approved equivalent means.

\(6\) Analyses supported by test evidence and, if available, service experience.

\(f\) A residual strength determination is required that substantiates the maximum damage size assumed in the fatigue tolerance evaluation. In determining inspection intervals based on damage growth, the residual strength evaluation must show that the remaining structure, after damage growth, is able to withstand design limit loads without failure.

\(g\) The effect of damage on stiffness, dynamic behavior, loads, and functional performance must be considered.

\(h\) Based on the requirements of this section, inspections and retirement times or approved equivalent means must be established to avoid catastrophic failure. The inspections and retirement times or approved equivalent means must be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by Section 29.1529 and Section A29.4 of Appendix A of this part.

\(i\) If inspections for any of the damage types identified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section cannot be established within the limitations of geometry, inspectability, or good design practice, then supplemental procedures, in conjunction with the PSE retirement time, must be established to minimize the risk of occurrence of these types of damage that could result in a catastrophic failure during the operational life of the rotorcraft.

### §29.573   Damage Tolerance and Fatigue Evaluation of Composite Rotorcraft Structures.

\(a\) Each applicant must evaluate the composite rotorcraft structure under the damage tolerance standards of paragraph (d) of this section unless the applicant establishes that a damage tolerance evaluation is impractical within the limits of geometry, inspectability, and good design practice. If an applicant establishes that it is impractical within the limits of geometry, inspectability, and good design practice, the applicant must do a fatigue evaluation in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

\(b\) The methodology used to establish compliance with this section must be submitted to and approved by the Administrator.

\(c\) Definitions:

\(1\) *Catastrophic failure* is an event that could prevent continued safe flight and landing.

\(2\) *Principal Structural Elements (PSEs)* are structural elements that contribute significantly to the carrying of flight or ground loads, the failure of which could result in catastrophic failure of the rotorcraft.

\(3\) *Threat Assessment* is an assessment that specifies the locations, types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects, intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur during manufacture or operation.

\(d\) Damage Tolerance Evaluation:

\(1\) Each applicant must show that catastrophic failure due to static and fatigue loads, considering the intrinsic or discrete manufacturing defects or accidental damage, is avoided throughout the operational life or prescribed inspection intervals of the rotorcraft by performing damage tolerance evaluations of the strength of composite PSEs and other parts, detail design points, and fabrication techniques. Each applicant must account for the effects of material and process variability along with environmental conditions in the strength and fatigue evaluations. Each applicant must evaluate parts that include PSEs of the airframe, main and tail rotor drive systems, main and tail rotor blades and hubs, rotor controls, fixed and movable control surfaces, engine and transmission mountings, landing gear, other parts, detail design points, and fabrication techniques deemed critical by the FAA. Each damage tolerance evaluation must include:

\(i\) The identification of all PSEs;

\(ii\) In-flight and ground measurements for determining the loads or stresses for all PSEs for all critical conditions throughout the range of limits in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.309   Design limitations.\|§29.309]] (including altitude effects), except that maneuvering load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in service;

\(iii\) The loading spectra as severe as those expected in service based on loads or stresses determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, including external load operations, if applicable, and other operations including high-torque events;

\(iv\) A threat assessment for all PSEs that specifies the locations, types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects, intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur during manufacture or operation; and

\(v\) An assessment of the residual strength and fatigue characteristics of all PSEs that supports the replacement times and inspection intervals established under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

\(2\) Each applicant must establish replacement times, inspections, or other procedures for all PSEs to require the repair or replacement of damaged parts before a catastrophic failure. These replacement times, inspections, or other procedures must be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1529   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§29.1529]].

\(i\) Replacement times for PSEs must be determined by tests, or by analysis supported by tests, and must show that the structure is able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in-service. In establishing these replacement times, the following items must be considered:

\(A\) Damage identified in the threat assessment required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section;

\(B\) Maximum acceptable manufacturing defects and in-service damage (*i.e.*, those that do not lower the residual strength below ultimate design loads and those that can be repaired to restore ultimate strength); and

\(C\) Ultimate load strength capability after applying repeated loads.

\(ii\) Inspection intervals for PSEs must be established to reveal any damage identified in the threat assessment required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section that may occur from fatigue or other in-service causes before such damage has grown to the extent that the component cannot sustain the required residual strength capability. In establishing these inspection intervals, the following items must be considered:

\(A\) The growth rate, including no-growth, of the damage under the repeated loads expected in-service determined by tests or analysis supported by tests;

\(B\) The required residual strength for the assumed damage established after considering the damage type, inspection interval, detectability of damage, and the techniques adopted for damage detection. The minimum required residual strength is limit load; and

\(C\) Whether the inspection will detect the damage growth before the minimum residual strength is reached and restored to ultimate load capability, or whether the component will require replacement.

\(3\) Each applicant must consider the effects of damage on stiffness, dynamic behavior, loads, and functional performance on all PSEs when substantiating the maximum assumed damage size and inspection interval.

\(e\) Fatigue Evaluation: If an applicant establishes that the damage tolerance evaluation described in paragraph (d) of this section is impractical within the limits of geometry, inspectability, or good design practice, the applicant must do a fatigue evaluation of the particular composite rotorcraft structure and:

\(1\) Identify all PSEs considered in the fatigue evaluation;

\(2\) Identify the types of damage for all PSEs considered in the fatigue evaluation;

\(3\) Establish supplemental procedures to minimize the risk of catastrophic failure associated with the damages identified in paragraph (d) of this section; and

\(4\) Include these supplemental procedures in the Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1529   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\|§29.1529]].

\(a\) Flight controls, including the collective pitch control, must operate with a sense of motion which corresponds to the effect on the rotorcraft.

\(b\) Twist-grip engine power controls must be designed so that, for lefthand operation, the motion of the pilot's hand is clockwise to increase power when the hand is viewed from the edge containing the index finger. Other engine power controls, excluding the collective control, must operate with a forward motion to increase power.

\(c\) Normal landing gear controls must operate downward to extend the landing gear.

\[Amdt. 29-24, 49 FR 44437, Nov. 6, 1984\]

### §29.783   Doors.

\(a\) Each closed cabin must have at least one adequate and easily accessible external door.

\(b\) Each external door must be located, and appropriate operating procedures must be established, to ensure that persons using the door will not be endangered by the rotors, propellers, engine intakes, and exhausts when the operating procedures are used.

\(c\) There must be means for locking crew and external passenger doors and for preventing their opening in flight inadvertently or as a result of mechanical failure. It must be possible to open external doors from inside and outside the cabin with the rotorcraft on the ground even though persons may be crowded against the door on the inside of the rotorcraft. The means of opening must be simple and obvious and so arranged and marked that it can be readily located and operated.

\(d\) There must be reasonable provisions to prevent the jamming of any external doors in a minor crash as a result of fuselage deformation under the following ultimate inertial forces except for cargo or service doors not suitable for use as an exit in an emergency:

\(1\) Upward—1.5g.

\(2\) Forward—4.0g.

\(3\) Sideward—2.0g.

\(4\) Downward—4.0g.

\(e\) There must be means for direct visual inspection of the locking mechanism by crewmembers to determine whether the external doors (including passenger, crew, service, and cargo doors) are fully locked. There must be visual means to signal to appropriate crewmembers when normally used external doors are closed and fully locked.

\(f\) For outward opening external doors usable for entrance or egress, there must be an auxiliary safety latching device to prevent the door from opening when the primary latching mechanism fails. If the door does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section with this device in place, suitable operating procedures must be established to prevent the use of the device during takeoff and landing.

\(g\) If an integral stair is installed in a passenger entry door that is qualified as a passenger emergency exit, the stair must be designed so that under the following conditions the effectiveness of passenger emergency egress will not be impaired:

\(1\) The door, integral stair, and operating mechanism have been subjected to the inertial forces specified in paragraph (d) of this section, acting separately relative to the surrounding structure.

\(2\) The rotorcraft is in the normal ground attitude and in each of the attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs, or primary members, as applicable, of the landing gear.

\(h\) Nonjettisonable doors used as ditching emergency exits must have means to enable them to be secured in the open position and remain secure for emergency egress in sea state conditions prescribed for ditching.

### §29.785   Seats, berths, litters, safety belts, and harnesses.

\(a\) Each seat, safety belt, harness, and adjacent part of the rotorcraft at each station designated for occupancy during takeoff and landing must be free of potentially injurious objects, sharp edges, protuberances, and hard surfaces and must be designed so that a person making proper use of these facilities will not suffer serious injury in an emergency landing as a result of the inertial factors specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]](b) and dynamic conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§29.562]].

\(b\) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury by a safety belt plus a shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious object, except as provided for in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§29.562]](c)(5). A shoulder harness (upper torso restraint), in combination with the safety belt, constitutes a torso restraint system as described in TSO-C114.

\(c\) Each occupant's seat must have a combined safety belt and shoulder harness with a single-point release. Each pilot's combined safety belt and shoulder harness must allow each pilot when seated with safety belt and shoulder harness fastened to perform all functions necessary for flight operations. There must be a means to secure belt and harness when not in use to prevent interference with the operation of the rotorcraft and with rapid egress in an emergency.

\(d\) If seat backs do not have a firm handhold, there must be hand grips or rails along each aisle to let the occupants steady themselves while using the aisle in moderately rough air.

\(e\) Each projecting object that would injure persons seated or moving about in the rotorcraft in normal flight must be padded.

\(f\) Each seat and its supporting structure must be designed for an occupant weight of at least 170 pounds, considering the maximum load factors, inertial forces, and reactions between the occupant, seat, and safety belt or harness corresponding with the applicable flight and ground-load conditions, including the emergency landing conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]](b). In addition—

\(1\) Each pilot seat must be designed for the reactions resulting from the application of the pilot forces prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.397   Limit pilot forces and torques.\|§29.397]]; and

\(2\) The inertial forces prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]](b) must be multiplied by a factor of 1.33 in determining the strength of the attachment of—

\(i\) Each seat to the structure; and

\(ii\) Each safety belt or harness to the seat or structure.

\(g\) When the safety belt and shoulder harness are combined, the rated strength of the safety belt and shoulder harness may not be less than that corresponding to the inertial forces specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]](b), considering the occupant weight of at least 170 pounds, considering the dimensional characteristics of the restraint system installation, and using a distribution of at least a 60-percent load to the safety belt and at least a 40-percent load to the shoulder harness. If the safety belt is capable of being used without the shoulder harness, the inertial forces specified must be met by the safety belt alone.

\(h\) When a headrest is used, the headrest and its supporting structure must be designed to resist the inertia forces specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]], with a 1.33 fitting factor and a head weight of at least 13 pounds.

\(i\) Each seating device system includes the device such as the seat, the cushions, the occupant restraint system and attachment devices.

\(j\) Each seating device system may use design features such as crushing or separation of certain parts of the seat in the design to reduce occupant loads for the emergency landing dynamic conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.562   Emergency landing dynamic conditions.\|§29.562]]; otherwise, the system must remain intact and must not interfere with rapid evacuation of the rotorcraft.

\(k\) For purposes of this section, a litter is defined as a device designed to carry a nonambulatory person, primarily in a recumbent position, into and on the rotorcraft. Each berth or litter must be designed to withstand the load reaction of an occupant weight of at least 170 pounds when the occupant is subjected to the forward inertial factors specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]](b). A berth or litter installed within 15° or less of the longitudinal axis of the rotorcraft must be provided with a padded end-board, cloth diaphragm, or equivalent means that can withstand the forward load reaction. A berth or litter oriented greater than 15° with the longitudinal axis of the rotorcraft must be equipped with appropriate restraints, such as straps or safety belts, to withstand the forward reaction. In addition—

\(1\) The berth or litter must have a restraint system and must not have corners or other protuberances likely to cause serious injury to a person occupying it during emergency landing conditions; and

\(2\) The berth or litter attachment and the occupant restraint system attachments to the structure must be designed to withstand the critical loads resulting from flight and ground load conditions and from the conditions prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]](b). The fitting factor required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.625   Fitting factors.\|§29.625]](d) shall be applied.

\[Doc. No. 5084, 29 FR 16150, Dec. 3, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 29-24, 49 FR 44437, Nov. 6, 1984; Amdt. 29-29, 54 FR 47320, Nov. 13, 1989; Amdt. 29-42, 63 FR 43285, Aug. 12, 1998\]

### §29.787   Cargo and baggage compartments.

\(a\) Each cargo and baggage compartment must be designed for its placarded maximum weight of contents and for the critical load distributions at the appropriate maximum load factors corresponding to the specified flight and ground load conditions, except the emergency landing conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]].

\(b\) There must be means to prevent the contents of any compartment from becoming a hazard by shifting under the loads specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

\(c\) Under the emergency landing conditions of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]], cargo and baggage compartments must—

\(1\) Be positioned so that if the contents break loose they are unlikely to cause injury to the occupants or restrict any of the escape facilities provided for use after an emergency landing; or

\(2\) Have sufficient strength to withstand the conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]], including the means of restraint and their attachments required by paragraph (b) of this section. Sufficient strength must be provided for the maximum authorized weight of cargo and baggage at the critical loading distribution.

\(d\) If cargo compartment lamps are installed, each lamp must be installed so as to prevent contact between lamp bulb and cargo.

\[Doc. No. 5084, 29 FR 16150, Dec. 3, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 29-12, 41 FR 55472, Dec. 20, 1976; Amdt. 29-31, 55 FR 38966, Sept. 21, 1990\]

### §29.801   Ditching.

\(a\) If certification with ditching provisions is requested, the rotorcraft must meet the requirements of this section and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.807   Passenger emergency exits.\|§§29.807]](d), 29.1411 and 29.1415.

\(b\) Each practicable design measure, compatible with the general characteristics of the rotorcraft, must be taken to minimize the probability that in an emergency landing on water, the behavior of the rotorcraft would cause immediate injury to the occupants or would make it impossible for them to escape.

\(c\) The probable behavior of the rotorcraft in a water landing must be investigated by model tests or by comparison with rotorcraft of similar configuration for which the ditching characteristics are known. Scoops, flaps, projections, and any other factors likely to affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the rotorcraft must be considered.

\(d\) It must be shown that, under reasonably probable water conditions, the flotation time and trim of the rotorcraft will allow the occupants to leave the rotorcraft and enter the liferafts required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1415   Ditching equipment.\|§29.1415]]. If compliance with this provision is shown by bouyancy and trim computations, appropriate allowances must be made for probable structural damage and leakage. If the rotorcraft has fuel tanks (with fuel jettisoning provisions) that can reasonably be expected to withstand a ditching without leakage, the jettisonable volume of fuel may be considered as bouyancy volume.

\(e\) Unless the effects of the collapse of external doors and windows are accounted for in the investigation of the probable behavior of the rotorcraft in a water landing (as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), the external doors and windows must be designed to withstand the probable maximum local pressures.

\[Amdt. 29-12, 41 FR 55472, Dec. 20, 1976\]

### §29.803   Emergency evacuation.

\(a\) Each crew and passenger area must have means for rapid evacuation in a crash landing, with the landing gear (1) extended and (2) retracted, considering the possibility of fire.

\(b\) Passenger entrance, crew, and service doors may be considered as emergency exits if they meet the requirements of this section and of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.805   Flight crew emergency exits.\|§§29.805]] through 29.815.

\(c\) \[Reserved\]

\(d\) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the following categories of rotorcraft must be tested in accordance with the requirements of appendix D of this part to demonstrate that the maximum seating capacity, including the crewmembers required by the operating rules, can be evacuated from the rotorcraft to the ground within 90 seconds:

\(1\) Rotorcraft with a seating capacity of more than 44 passengers.

\(2\) Rotorcraft with all of the following:

\(i\) Ten or more passengers per passenger exit as determined under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.807   Passenger emergency exits.\|§29.807]](b).

\(ii\) No main aisle, as described in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.815   Main aisle width.\|§29.815]], for each row of passenger seats.

\(iii\) Access to each passenger exit for each passenger by virtue of design features of seats, such as folding or break-over seat backs or folding seats.

\(e\) A combination of analysis and tests may be used to show that the rotorcraft is capable of being evacuated within 90 seconds under the conditions specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.803   Emergency evacuation.\|§29.803]](d) if the Administrator finds that the combination of analysis and tests will provide data, with respect to the emergency evacuation capability of the rotorcraft, equivalent to that which would be obtained by actual demonstration.

</div>

\(c\) *Passenger emergency exits; other than side-of-fuselage.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section—

\(1\) There must be enough openings in the top, bottom, or ends of the fuselage to allow evacuation with the rotorcraft on its side; or

\(2\) The probability of the rotorcraft coming to rest on its side in a crash landing must be extremely remote.

\(d\) *Ditching emergency exits for passengers.* If certification with ditching provisions is requested, ditching emergency exits must be provided in accordance with the following requirements and must be proven by test, demonstration, or analysis unless the emergency exits required by paragraph (b) of this section already meet these requirements.

\(1\) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilots seats, of nine seats or less, one exit above the waterline in each side of the rotorcraft, meeting at least the dimensions of a Type IV exit.

\(2\) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilots seats, of 10 seats or more, one exit above the waterline in a side of the rotorcraft meeting at least the dimensions of a Type III exit, for each unit (or part of a unit) of 35 passenger seats, but no less than two such exits in the passenger cabin, with one on each side of the rotorcraft. However, where it has been shown through analysis, ditching demonstrations, or any other tests found necessary by the Administrator, that the evacuation capability of the rotorcraft during ditching is improved by the use of larger exits, or by other means, the passenger seat to exit ratio may be increased.

\(3\) Flotation devices, whether stowed or deployed, may not interfere with or obstruct the exits.

\(e\) *Ramp exits.* One Type I exit only, or one Type II exit only, that is required in the side of the fuselage under paragraph (b) of this section, may be installed instead in the ramp of floor ramp rotorcraft if—

\(1\) Its installation in the side of the fuselage is impractical; and

\(2\) Its installation in the ramp meets [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.813   Emergency exit access.\|§29.813]].

\(c\) The means of opening each emergency exit must be simple and obvious and may not require exceptional effort.

\(d\) There must be means for locking each emergency exit and for preventing opening in flight inadvertently or as a result of mechanical failure.

\(e\) There must be means to minimize the probability of the jamming of any emergency exit in a minor crash landing as a result of fuselage deformation under the ultimate inertial forces in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.783   Doors.\|§29.783]](d).

\(f\) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, each land-based rotorcraft emergency exit must have an approved slide as stated in paragraph (g) of this section, or its equivalent, to assist occupants in descending to the ground from each floor level exit and an approved rope, or its equivalent, for all other exits, if the exit threshold is more that 6 feet above the ground—

\(1\) With the rotorcraft on the ground and with the landing gear extended;

\(2\) With one or more legs or part of the landing gear collapsed, broken, or not extended; and

\(3\) With the rotorcraft resting on its side, if required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.803   Emergency evacuation.\|§29.803]](d).

\(g\) The slide for each passenger emergency exit must be a self-supporting slide or equivalent, and must be designed to meet the following requirements:

\(1\) It must be automatically deployed, and deployment must begin during the interval between the time the exit opening means is actuated from inside the rotorcraft and the time the exit is fully opened. However, each passenger emergency exit which is also a passenger entrance door or a service door must be provided with means to prevent deployment of the slide when the exit is opened from either the inside or the outside under nonemergency conditions for normal use.

\(2\) It must be automatically erected within 10 seconds after deployment is begun.

\(3\) It must be of such length after full deployment that the lower end is self-supporting on the ground and provides safe evacuation of occupants to the ground after collapse of one or more legs or part of the landing gear.

\(4\) It must have the capability, in 25-knot winds directed from the most critical angle, to deploy and, with the assistance of only one person, to remain usable after full deployment to evacuate occupants safely to the ground.

\(5\) Each slide installation must be qualified by five consecutive deployment and inflation tests conducted (per exit) without failure, and at least three tests of each such five-test series must be conducted using a single representative sample of the device. The sample devices must be deployed and inflated by the system's primary means after being subjected to the inertia forces specified in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.561   General.\|§29.561]](b). If any part of the system fails or does not function properly during the required tests, the cause of the failure or malfunction must be corrected by positive means and after that, the full series of five consecutive deployment and inflation tests must be conducted without failure.

\(h\) For rotorcraft having 30 or fewer passenger seats and having an exit threshold more than 6 feet above the ground, a rope or other assist means may be used in place of the slide specified in paragraph (f) of this section, provided an evacuation demonstration is accomplished as prescribed in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.803   Emergency evacuation.\|§29.803]](d) or (e).

\(i\) If a rope, with its attachment, is used for compliance with paragraph (f), (g), or (h) of this section, it must—

\(1\) Withstand a 400-pound static load; and

\(2\) Attach to the fuselage structure at or above the top of the emergency exit opening, or at another approved location if the stowed rope would reduce the pilot's view in flight.

\(a\) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of opening must be conspicuously marked for the guidance of occupants using the exits in daylight or in the dark. Such markings must be designed to remain visible for rotorcraft equipped for overwater flights if the rotorcraft is capsized and the cabin is submerged.

\(b\) The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin.

\(c\) The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle. There must be a locating sign—

\(1\) Next to or above the aisle near each floor emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two exits if both exists can be seen readily from that sign; and

\(2\) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by it, except that if this is not possible the sign may be placed at another appropriate location.

\(d\) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must have white letters 1 inch high on a red background 2 inches high, be self or electrically illuminated, and have a minimum luminescence (brightness) of at least 160 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed if this will increase the emergency illumination of the passenger compartment.

\(e\) The location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for opening must be shown—

\(1\) For each emergency exit, by a marking on or near the exit that is readable from a distance of 30 inches; and

\(2\) For each Type I or Type II emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, by—

\(i\) A red arrow, with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70 degrees of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length; and

\(ii\) The word “open” in red letters 1 inch high, placed horizontally near the head of the arrow.

\(f\) Each emergency exit, and its means of opening, must be marked on the outside of the rotorcraft. In addition, the following apply:

\(1\) There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining each passenger emergency exit, except small rotorcraft with a maximum weight of 12,500 pounds or less may have a 2-inch colored band outlining each exit release lever or device of passenger emergency exits which are normally used doors.

\(2\) Each outside marking, including the band, must have color contrast to be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage surface. The contrast must be such that, if the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent. “Reflectance” is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives. When the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.

\(g\) Exits marked as such, though in excess of the required number of exits, must meet the requirements for emergency exits of the particular type. Emergency exits need only be marked with the word “Exit.”

\(b\) *Category A; engine isolation.* For each category A rotorcraft, the powerplants must be arranged and isolated from each other to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so that the failure or malfunction of any engine, or the failure of any system that can affect any engine, will not—

\(1\) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; or

\(2\) Require immediate action, other than normal pilot action with primary flight controls, by any crewmember to maintain safe operation.

\(c\) *Category A; control of engine rotation.* For each Category A rotorcraft, there must be a means for stopping the rotation of any engine individually in flight, except that, for turbine engine installations, the means for stopping the engine need be provided only where necessary for safety. In addition—

\(1\) Each component of the engine stopping system that is located on the engine side of the firewall, and that might be exposed to fire, must be at least fire resistant; or

### §29.907   Engine vibration.

\(a\) Each engine must be installed to prevent the harmful vibration of any part of the engine or rotorcraft.

\(b\) The addition of the rotor and the rotor drive system to the engine may not subject the principal rotating parts of the engine to excessive vibration stresses. This must be shown by a vibration investigation.

### §29.908   Cooling fans.

For cooling fans that are a part of a powerplant installation the following apply:

\(a\) *Category A.* For cooling fans installed in Category A rotorcraft, it must be shown that a fan blade failure will not prevent continued safe flight either because of damage caused by the failed blade or loss of cooling air.

\(b\) *Category B.* For cooling fans installed in category B rotorcraft, there must be means to protect the rotorcraft and allow a safe landing if a fan blade fails. It must be shown that—

\(1\) The fan blade would be contained in the case of a failure;

\(2\) Each fan is located so that a fan blade failure will not jeopardize safety; or

\(3\) Each fan blade can withstand an ultimate load of 1.5 times the centrifugal force expected in service, limited by either—

### Rotor Drive System

### §29.917   Design.

\(a\) *General.* The rotor drive system includes any part necessary to transmit power from the engines to the rotor hubs. This includes gear boxes, shafting, universal joints, couplings, rotor brake assemblies, clutches, supporting bearings for shafting, any attendant accessory pads or drives, and any cooling fans that are a part of, attached to, or mounted on the rotor drive system.

\(b\) *Design assessment.* A design assessment must be performed to ensure that the rotor drive system functions safely over the full range of conditions for which certification is sought. The design assessment must include a detailed failure analysis to identify all failures that will prevent continued safe flight or safe landing and must identify the means to minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.

\(c\) *Arrangement.* Rotor drive systems must be arranged as follows:

\(1\) Each rotor drive system of multiengine rotorcraft must be arranged so that each rotor necessary for operation and control will continue to be driven by the remaining engines if any engine fails.

\(2\) For single-engine rotorcraft, each rotor drive system must be so arranged that each rotor necessary for control in autorotation will continue to be driven by the main rotors after disengagement of the engine from the main and auxiliary rotors.

\(3\) Each rotor drive system must incorporate a unit for each engine to automatically disengage that engine from the main and auxiliary rotors if that engine fails.

\(4\) If a torque limiting device is used in the rotor drive system, it must be located so as to allow continued control of the rotorcraft when the device is operating.

\(5\) If the rotors must be phased for intermeshing, each system must provide constant and positive phase relationship under any operating condition.

\(6\) If a rotor dephasing device is incorporated, there must be means to keep the rotors locked in proper phase before operation.

\[Doc. No. 5084, 29 FR 16150, Dec. 3, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 29-12, 41 FR 55472, Dec. 20, 1976; Amdt. 29-40, 61 FR 21908, May 10, 1996\]

### §29.921   Rotor brake.

If there is a means to control the rotation of the rotor drive system independently of the engine, any limitations on the use of that means must be specified, and the control for that means must be guarded to prevent inadvertent operation.

### §29.923   Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.

\(a\) *Endurance tests, general.* Each rotor drive system and rotor control mechanism must be tested, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) through (n) and (p) of this section, for at least 200 hours plus the time required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (k) of this section. These tests must be conducted as follows:

\(1\) Ten-hour test cycles must be used, except that the test cycle must be extended to include the OEI test of paragraphs (b)(2) and (k), of this section if OEI ratings are requested.

\(2\) The tests must be conducted on the rotorcraft.

\(3\) The test torque and rotational speed must be—

\(i\) Determined by the powerplant limitations; and

\(ii\) Absorbed by the rotors to be approved for the rotorcraft.

\(b\) *Endurance tests; takeoff run.* The takeoff run must be conducted as follows:

\(1\) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the takeoff torque run must consist of 1 hour of alternate runs of 5 minutes at takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque, and 5 minutes at as low an engine idle speed as practicable. The engine must be declutched from the rotor drive system, and the rotor brake, if furnished and so intended, must be applied during the first minute of the idle run. During the remaining 4 minutes of the idle run, the clutch must be engaged so that the engine drives the rotors at the minimum practical r.p.m. The engine and the rotor drive system must be accelerated at the maximum rate. When declutching the engine, it must be decelerated rapidly enough to allow the operation of the overrunning clutch.

\(2\) For helicopters for which the use of a 21⁄2 -minute OEI rating is requested, the takeoff run must be conducted as prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except for the third and sixth runs for which the takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque are prescribed in that paragraph. For these runs, the following apply:

\(i\) Each run must consist of at least one period of 21⁄2 minutes with takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque on all engines.

\(ii\) Each run must consist of at least one period, for each engine in sequence, during which that engine simulates a power failure and the remaining engines are run at the 21⁄2 -minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 21⁄2 -minute OEI torque for 21⁄2 minutes.

\(3\) For multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of 30-second/2-minute OEI power is requested, the takeoff run must be conducted as prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except for the following:

\(i\) Immediately following any one 5-minute power-on run required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, simulate a failure for each power source in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI power to the remaining affected drive system power inputs for not less than 30 seconds. Each application of 30-second OEI power must be followed by two applications of the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with the 2 minute OEI power for not less than 2 minutes each; the second application must follow a period at stabilized continuous or 30 minute OEI power (whichever is requested by the applicant). At least one run sequence must be conducted from a simulated “flight idle” condition. When conducted on a bench test, the test sequence must be conducted following stabilization at take-off power.

\(ii\) For the purpose of this paragraph, an affected power input includes all parts of the rotor drive system which can be adversely affected by the application of higher or asymmetric torque and speed prescribed by the test.

\(iii\) This test may be conducted on a representative bench test facility when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this power or would result in premature engine removals during the test. The loads, the vibration frequency, and the methods of application to the affected rotor drive system components must be representative of rotorcraft conditions. Test components must be those used to show compliance with the remainder of this section.

\(c\) *Endurance tests; maximum continuous run.* Three hours of continuous operation at maximum continuous torque and the maximum speed for use with maximum continuous torque must be conducted as follows:

\(1\) The main rotor controls must be operated at a minimum of 15 times each hour through the main rotor pitch positions of maximum vertical thrust, maximum forward thrust component, maximum aft thrust component, maximum left thrust component, and maximum right thrust component, except that the control movements need not produce loads or blade flapping motion exceeding the maximum loads of motions encountered in flight.

\(2\) The directional controls must be operated at a minimum of 15 times each hour through the control extremes of maximum right turning torque, neutral torque as required by the power applied to the main rotor, and maximum left turning torque.

\(3\) Each maximum control position must be held for at least 10 seconds, and the rate of change of control position must be at least as rapid as that for normal operation.

\(d\) *Endurance tests; 90 percent of maximum continuous run.* One hour of continuous operation at 90 percent of maximum continuous torque and the maximum speed for use with 90 percent of maximum continuous torque must be conducted.

\(e\) *Endurance tests; 80 percent of maximum continuous run.* One hour of continuous operation at 80 percent of maximum continuous torque and the minimum speed for use with 80 percent of maximum continuous torque must be conducted.

\(f\) *Endurance tests; 60 percent of maximum continuous run.* Two hours or, for helicopters for which the use of either 30-minute OEI power or continuous OEI power is requested, 1 hour of continuous operation at 60 percent of maximum continuous torque and the minimum speed for use with 60 percent of maximum continuous torque must be conducted.

\(g\) *Endurance tests; engine malfunctioning run.* It must be determined whether malfunctioning of components, such as the engine fuel or ignition systems, or whether unequal engine power can cause dynamic conditions detrimental to the drive system. If so, a suitable number of hours of operation must be accomplished under those conditions, 1 hour of which must be included in each cycle, and the remaining hours of which must be accomplished at the end of the 20 cycles. If no detrimental condition results, an additional hour of operation in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section must be conducted in accordance with the run schedule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section without consideration of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

\(h\) *Endurance tests; overspeed run.* One hour of continuous operation must be conducted at maximum continuous torque and the maximum power-on overspeed expected in service, assuming that speed and torque limiting devices, if any, function properly.

\(i\) *Endurance tests; rotor control positions.* When the rotor controls are not being cycled during the tie-down tests, the rotor must be operated, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, to produce each of the maximum thrust positions for the following percentages of test time (except that the control positions need not produce loads or blade flapping motion exceeding the maximum loads or motions encountered in flight):

\(1\) For full vertical thrust, 20 percent.

\(2\) For the forward thrust component, 50 percent.

\(3\) For the right thrust component, 10 percent.

\(4\) For the left thrust component, 10 percent.

\(5\) For the aft thrust component, 10 percent.

\(j\) *Endurance tests, clutch and brake engagements.* A total of at least 400 clutch and brake engagements, including the engagements of paragraph (b) of this section, must be made during the takeoff torque runs and, if necessary, at each change of torque and speed throughout the test. In each clutch engagement, the shaft on the driven side of the clutch must be accelerated from rest. The clutch engagements must be accomplished at the speed and by the method prescribed by the applicant. During deceleration after each clutch engagement, the engines must be stopped rapidly enough to allow the engines to be automatically disengaged from the rotors and rotor drives. If a rotor brake is installed for stopping the rotor, the clutch, during brake engagements, must be disengaged above 40 percent of maximum continuous rotor speed and the rotors allowed to decelerate to 40 percent of maximum continuous rotor speed, at which time the rotor brake must be applied. If the clutch design does not allow stopping the rotors with the engine running, or if no clutch is provided, the engine must be stopped before each application of the rotor brake, and then immediately be started after the rotors stop.

\(k\) *Endurance tests; OEI power run*—(1) *30-minute OEI power run.* For rotorcraft for which the use of 30-minute OEI power is requested, a run at 30-minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-minute OEI torque must be conducted as follows: For each engine, in sequence, that engine must be inoperative and the remaining engines must be run for a 30-minute period.

\(2\) *Continuous OEI power run.* For rotorcraft for which the use of continuous OEI power is requested, a run at continuous OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with continuous OEI torque must be conducted as follows: For each engine, in sequence, that engine must be inoperative and the remaining engines must be run for 1 hour.

\(3\) The number of periods prescribed in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this section may not be less than the number of engines, nor may it be less than two.

\(l\) \[Reserved\]

\(m\) Any components that are affected by maneuvering and gust loads must be investigated for the same flight conditions as are the main rotors, and their service lives must be determined by fatigue tests or by other acceptable methods. In addition, a level of safety equal to that of the main rotors must be provided for—

\(1\) Each component in the rotor drive system whose failure would cause an uncontrolled landing;

\(2\) Each component essential to the phasing of rotors on multirotor rotorcraft, or that furnishes a driving link for the essential control of rotors in autorotation; and

\(3\) Each component common to two or more engines on multiengine rotorcraft.

\(n\) *Special tests.* Each rotor drive system designed to operate at two or more gear ratios must be subjected to special testing for durations necessary to substantiate the safety of the rotor drive system.

\(o\) Each part tested as prescribed in this section must be in a serviceable condition at the end of the tests. No intervening disassembly which might affect test results may be conducted.

\(p\) *Endurance tests; operating lubricants.* To be approved for use in rotor drive and control systems, lubricants must meet the specifications of lubricants used during the tests prescribed by this section. Additional or alternate lubricants may be qualified by equivalent testing or by comparative analysis of lubricant specifications and rotor drive and control system characteristics. In addition—

\(1\) At least three 10-hour cycles required by this section must be conducted with transmission and gearbox lubricant temperatures, at the location prescribed for measurement, not lower than the maximum operating temperature for which approval is requested;

\(2\) For pressure lubricated systems, at least three 10-hour cycles required by this section must be conducted with the lubricant pressure, at the location prescribed for measurement, not higher than the minimum operating pressure for which approval is requested; and

\(3\) The test conditions of paragraphs (p)(1) and (p)(2) of this section must be applied simultaneously and must be extended to include operation at any one-engine-inoperative rating for which approval is requested.

### §29.927   Additional tests.

\(a\) Any additional dynamic, endurance, and operational tests, and vibratory investigations necessary to determine that the rotor drive mechanism is safe, must be performed.

\(b\) If turbine engine torque output to the transmission can exceed the highest engine or transmission torque limit, and that output is not directly controlled by the pilot under normal operating conditions (such as where the primary engine power control is accomplished through the flight control), the following test must be made:

\(1\) Under conditions associated with all engines operating, make 200 applications, for 10 seconds each, of torque that is at least equal to the lesser of—

\(i\) The maximum torque used in meeting [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.923   Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.\|§29.923]] plus 10 percent; or

\(ii\) The maximum torque attainable under probable operating conditions, assuming that torque limiting devices, if any, function properly.

\(2\) For multiengine rotorcraft under conditions associated with each engine, in turn, becoming inoperative, apply to the remaining transmission torque inputs the maximum torque attainable under probable operating conditions, assuming that torque limiting devices, if any, function properly. Each transmission input must be tested at this maximum torque for at least fifteen minutes.

\(c\) *Lubrication system failure.* For lubrication systems required for proper operation of rotor drive systems, the following apply:

\(1\) *Category A.* Unless such failures are extremely remote, it must be shown by test that any failure which results in loss of lubricant in any normal use lubrication system will not prevent continued safe operation, although not necessarily without damage, at a torque and rotational speed prescribed by the applicant for continued flight, for at least 30 minutes after perception by the flightcrew of the lubrication system failure or loss of lubricant.

\(2\) *Category B.* The requirements of Category A apply except that the rotor drive system need only be capable of operating under autorotative conditions for at least 15 minutes.

\(d\) *Overspeed test.* The rotor drive system must be subjected to 50 overspeed runs, each 30 ±3 seconds in duration, at not less than either the higher of the rotational speed to be expected from an engine control device failure or 105 percent of the maximum rotational speed, including transients, to be expected in service. If speed and torque limiting devices are installed, are independent of the normal engine control, and are shown to be reliable, their rotational speed limits need not be exceeded. These runs must be conducted as follows:

\(1\) Overspeed runs must be alternated with stabilizing runs of from 1 to 5 minutes duration each at 60 to 80 percent of maximum continuous speed.

\(2\) Acceleration and deceleration must be accomplished in a period not longer than 10 seconds (except where maximum engine acceleration rate will require more than 10 seconds), and the time for changing speeds may not be deducted from the specified time for the overspeed runs.

\(3\) Overspeed runs must be made with the rotors in the flattest pitch for smooth operation.

\(e\) The tests prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section must be conducted on the rotorcraft and the torque must be absorbed by the rotors to be installed, except that other ground or flight test facilities with other appropriate methods of torque absorption may be used if the conditions of support and vibration closely simulate the conditions that would exist during a test on the rotorcraft.

\(f\) Each test prescribed by this section must be conducted without intervening disassembly and, except for the lubrication system failure test required by paragraph (c) of this section, each part tested must be in a serviceable condition at the conclusion of the test.

### §29.931   Shafting critical speed.

\(a\) The critical speeds of any shafting must be determined by demonstration except that analytical methods may be used if reliable methods of analysis are available for the particular design.

\(b\) If any critical speed lies within, or close to, the operating ranges for idling, power-on, and autorotative conditions, the stresses occurring at that speed must be within safe limits. This must be shown by tests.

\(c\) If analytical methods are used and show that no critical speed lies within the permissible operating ranges, the margins between the calculated critical speeds and the limits of the allowable operating ranges must be adequate to allow for possible variations between the computed and actual values.

### §29.935   Shafting joints.

Each universal joint, slip joint, and other shafting joints whose lubrication is necessary for operation must have provision for lubrication.

### §29.939   Turbine engine operating characteristics.

\(a\) Turbine engine operating characteristics must be investigated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics (such as stall, surge, of flameout) are present, to a hazardous degree, during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations of the rotorcraft and of the engine.

\(b\) The turbine engine air inlet system may not, as a result of airflow distortion during normal operation, cause vibration harmful to the engine.

\(c\) For governor-controlled engines, it must be shown that there exists no hazardous torsional instability of the drive system associated with critical combinations of power, rotational speed, and control displacement.

### Fuel System

### §29.951   General.

\(a\) Each fuel system must be constructed and arranged to ensure a flow of fuel at a rate and pressure established for proper engine and auxiliary power unit functioning under any likely operating conditions, including the maneuvers for which certification is requested and during which the engine or auxiliary power unit is permitted to be in operation.

\(b\) Each fuel system must be arranged so that—

\(1\) No engine or fuel pump can draw fuel from more than one tank at a time; or

\(2\) There are means to prevent introducing air into the system.

\(c\) Each fuel system for a turbine engine must be capable of sustained operation throughout its flow and pressure range with fuel initially saturated with water at 80 degrees F. and having 0.75cc of free water per gallon added and cooled to the most critical condition for icing likely to be encountered in operation.

\[Doc. No. 5084, 29 FR 16150, Dec. 3, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 29-10, 39 FR 35462, Oct. 1, 1974; Amdt. 29-12, 41 FR 55473, Dec. 20, 1976\]

### §29.952   Fuel system crash resistance.

Unless other means acceptable to the Administrator are employed to minimize the hazard of fuel fires to occupants following an otherwise survivable impact (crash landing), the fuel systems must incorporate the design features of this section. These systems must be shown to be capable of sustaining the static and dynamic deceleration loads of this section, considered as ultimate loads acting alone, measured at the system component's center of gravity without structural damage to the system components, fuel tanks, or their attachments that would leak fuel to an ignition source.

\(a\) *Drop test requirements.* Each tank, or the most critical tank, must be drop-tested as follows:

\(1\) The drop height must be at least 50 feet.

\(2\) The drop impact surface must be nondeforming.

\(3\) The tanks must be filled with water to 80 percent of the normal, full capacity.

\(4\) The tank must be enclosed in a surrounding structure representative of the installation unless it can be established that the surrounding structure is free of projections or other design features likely to contribute to upture of the tank.

\(5\) The tank must drop freely and impact in a horizontal position ±10°.

\(6\) After the drop test, there must be no leakage.

\(b\) *Fuel tank load factors.* Except for fuel tanks located so that tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, such as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed and installed to retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, acting alone.

\(1\) For fuel tanks in the cabin:

\(i\) Upward—4g.

\(ii\) Forward—16g.

\(iii\) Sideward—8g.

\(iv\) Downward—20g.

\(2\) For fuel tanks located above or behind the crew or passenger compartment that, if loosened, could injure an occupant in an emergency landing:

\(i\) Upward—1.5g.

\(ii\) Forward—8g.

\(iii\) Sideward—2g.

\(iv\) Downward—4g.

\(3\) For fuel tanks in other areas:

\(i\) Upward—1.5g.

\(ii\) Forward—4g.

\(iii\) Sideward—2g.

\(iv\) Downward—4g.

\(c\) *Fuel line self-sealing breakaway couplings.* Self-sealing breakaway couplings must be installed unless hazardous relative motion of fuel system components to each other or to local rotorcraft structure is demonstrated to be extremely improbable or unless other means are provided. The couplings or equivalent devices must be installed at all fuel tank-to-fuel line connections, tank-to-tank interconnects, and at other points in the fuel system where local structural deformation could lead to the release of fuel.

\(1\) The design and construction of self-sealing breakaway couplings must incorporate the following design features:

\(i\) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line. The separation load must in no case be less than 300 pounds, regardless of the size of the fluid line.

\(ii\) A breakaway coupling must separate whenever its ultimate load (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) is applied in the failure modes most likely to occur.

\(iii\) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to visually ascertain that the coupling is locked together (leak-free) and is open during normal installation and service.

\(iv\) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to prevent uncoupling or unintended closing due to operational shocks, vibrations, or accelerations.

However, the error need not be less than ±30 feet.

\(g\) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, if the static pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate static pressure source, the means for selecting one or the other source must be designed so that—

\(d\) *Slow cruise.* Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 0.9 VMINI to 1.3 VMINI or 20 knots above trim speed, whichever is greater, with—

\(1\) The helicopter trimmed and power adjusted for level flight at 1.1 VMINI; and

\(2\) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).

\(e\) *Descent.* Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 20 knots either side of trim with—

\(1\) The helicopter trimmed at 0.8 VH or 0.8 VNEI (or 0.8 VLE for the landing gear extended case), whichever is lower;

\(f\) *Approach.* Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 0.7 times the minimum recommended approach speed to 20 knots above the maximum recommended approach speed with—

\(1\) The helicopter trimmed at the recommended approach speed or speeds;

\(2\) Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable; and

\(3\) Power required to maintain a 3° glide path and power required to maintain the steepest approach gradient for which approval is requested.

V. *Static Lateral Directional Stability*

\(a\) Static directional stability must be positive throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed. In straight and steady sideslips up to ±10° from trim, directional control position must increase without discontinuity with the angle of sideslip, except for a small range of sideslip angles around trim. At greater angles up to the maximum sideslip angle appropriate to the type, increased directional control position must produce an increased angle of sideslip. It must be possible to maintain balanced flight without exceptional pilot skill or alertness.

\(b\) During sideslips up to ±10° from trim throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed there must be no negative dihedral stability perceptible to the pilot through lateral control motion or force. Longitudinal cyclic movement with sideslip must not be excessive.

VI\. *Dynamic stability.* (a) Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp to 1⁄2 amplitude in not more than one cycle.

\(b\) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less than 10 seconds must damp to 1⁄2 amplitude in not more than two cycles.

\(c\) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more but less than 20 seconds must be damped.

\(d\) Any oscillation having a period of 20 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 20 seconds.

\(e\) Any aperiodic response may not achieve double amplitude in less than 9 seconds.

VII\. *Stability Augmentation System (SAS)*

\(a\) If a SAS is used, the reliability of the SAS must be related to the effects of its failure. Any SAS failure condition that would prevent continued safe flight and landing must be extremely improbable. It must be shown that, for any failure condition of the SAS that is not shown to be extremely improbable—

\(1\) The helicopter is safely controllable when the failure or malfunction occurs at any speed or altitude within the approved IFR operating limitations; and

\(2\) The overall flight characteristics of the helicopter allow for prolonged instrument flight without undue pilot effort. Additional unrelated probable failures affecting the control system must be considered. In addition—

\(i\) The controllability and maneuverability requirements in Subpart B must be met throughout a practical flight envelope;

\(ii\) The flight control, trim, and dynamic stability characteristics must not be impaired below a level needed to allow continued safe flight and landing;

\(iii\) For Category A helicopters, the dynamic stability requirements of Subpart B must also be met throughout a practical flight envelope; and

\(iv\) The static longitudinal and static directional stability requirements of Subpart B must be met throughout a practical flight envelope.

\(b\) The SAS must be designed so that it cannot create a hazardous deviation in flight path or produce hazardous loads on the helicopter during normal operation or in the event of malfunction or failure, assuming corrective action begins within an appropriate period of time. Where multiple systems are installed, subsequent malfunction conditions must be considered in sequence unless their occurrence is shown to be improbable.

VIII\. *Equipment, systems, and installation.* The basic equipment and installation must comply with Subpart F of Part 29 through Amendment 29-14, with the following exceptions and additions:

\(a\) *Flight and navigation instruments.* (1) A magnetic gyro-stabilized direction indicator instead of the gyroscopic direction indicator required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1303   Flight and navigation instruments.\|§29.1303]](h); and

\(2\) A standby attitude indicator which meets the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1303   Flight and navigation instruments.\|§§29.1303]](g)(1) through (7), instead of a rate-of-turn indicator required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1303   Flight and navigation instruments.\|§29.1303]](g). If standby batteries are provided, they may be charged from the aircraft electrical system if adequate isolation is incorporated. The system must be designed so that the standby batteries may not be used for engine starting.

\(b\) *Miscellaneous requirements.* (1) Instrument systems and other systems essential for IFR flight that could be adversely affected by icing must be provided with adequate ice protection whether or not the rotorcraft is certificated for operation in icing conditions.

\(2\) There must be means in the generating system to automatically de-energize and disconnect from the main bus any power source developing hazardous overvoltage.

\(3\) Each required flight instrument using a power supply (electric, vacuum, etc.) must have a visual means integral with the instrument to indicate the adequacy of the power being supplied.

\(4\) When multiple systems performing like functions are required, each system must be grouped, routed, and spaced so that physical separation between systems is provided to ensure that a single malfunction will not adversely affect more than one system.

\(5\) For systems that operate the required flight instruments at each pilot's station—

\(i\) Only the required flight instruments for the first pilot may be connected to that operating system;

\(ii\) Additional instruments, systems, or equipment may not be connected to an operating system for a second pilot unless provisions are made to ensure the continued normal functioning of the required instruments in the event of any malfunction of the additional instruments, systems, or equipment which is not shown to be extremely improbable;

\(iii\) The equipment, systems, and installations must be designed so that one display of the information essential to the safety of flight which is provided by the instruments will remain available to a pilot, without additional crew-member action, after any single failure or combination of failures that is not shown to be extremely improbable; and

\(iv\) For single-pilot configurations, instruments which require a static source must be provided with a means of selecting an alternate source and that source must be calibrated.

\(c\) *Thunderstorm lights.* In addition to the instrument lights required by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1381   Instrument lights.\|§29.1381]](a), thunderstorm lights which provide high intensity white flood lighting to the basic flight instruments must be provided. The thunderstorm lights must be installed to meet the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft#§29.1381   Instrument lights.\|§29.1381]](b).

IX\. *Rotorcraft Flight Manual.* A Rotorcraft Flight Manual or Rotorcraft Flight Manual IFR Supplement must be provided and must contain—

\(a\) *Limitations.* The approved IFR flight envelope, the IFR flightcrew composition, the revised kinds of operation, and the steepest IFR precision approach gradient for which the helicopter is approved;

### Appendix C to Part 29—Icing Certification

\(a\) *Continuous maximum icing.* The maximum continuous intensity of atmospheric icing conditions (continuous maximum icing) is defined by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the interrelationship of these three variables as shown in Figure 1 of this appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and temperature is given in Figure 2 of this appendix. The interrelationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is determined from Figures 1 and 2. The cloud liquid water content for continuous maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 17.4 nautical miles, is determined by the value of liquid water content of Figure 1, multiplied by the appropriate factor from Figure 3 of this appendix.

\(b\) *Intermittent maximum icing.* The intermittent maximum intensity of atmospheric icing conditions (intermittent maximum icing) is defined by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the interrelationship of these three variables as shown in Figure 4 of this appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and temperature is given in Figure 5 of this appendix. The interrelationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is determined from Figures 4 and 5. The cloud liquid water content for intermittent maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 2.6 nautical miles, is determined by the value of cloud liquid water content of Figure 4 multiplied by the appropriate factor in Figure 6 of this appendix.

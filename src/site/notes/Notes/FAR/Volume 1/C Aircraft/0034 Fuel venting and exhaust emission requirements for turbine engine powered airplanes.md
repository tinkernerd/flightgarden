### §34.3   General requirements.

\(a\) This part provides for the approval or acceptance by the Administrator or the Administrator of the EPA of testing and sampling methods, analytical techniques, and related equipment not identical to those specified in this part. Before either approves or accepts any such alternate, equivalent, or otherwise nonidentical procedures or equipment, the Administrator or the Administrator of the EPA shall consult with the other in determining whether or not the action requires rulemaking under sections 231 and 232 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, consistent with the responsibilities of the Administrator of the EPA and the Secretary of Transportation under sections 231 and 232 of the Clean Air Act.

\(b\) Under section 232 of the Act, the Secretary of Transportation issues regulations to ensure compliance with 40 CFR part 87. This authority has been delegated to the Administrator of the FAA (49 CFR 1.47).

\(c\) *U.S. airplanes.* This part applies to civil airplanes that are powered by aircraft gas turbine engines of the classes specified herein and that have U.S. standard airworthiness certificates.

\(d\) *Foreign airplanes.* Pursuant to the definition of “aircraft” in 40 CFR 87.1, this regulation applies to civil airplanes that are powered by aircraft gas turbine engines of the classes specified herein and that have foreign airworthiness certificates that are equivalent to U.S. standard airworthiness certificates. This regulation applies only to those foreign civil airplanes that, if registered in the United States, would be required by applicable regulations to have a U.S. standard airworthiness certificate in order to conduct the operations intended for the airplane. Pursuant to 40 CFR 87.3(c), this regulation does not apply where it would be inconsistent with an obligation assumed by the United States to a foreign country in a treaty, convention, or agreement.

\(e\) Reference in this regulation to 40 CFR part 87 refers to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter I—Environmental Protection Agency, part 87, Control of Air Pollution from Aircraft and Aircraft Engines (40 CFR part 87).

\(f\) This part contains regulations to ensure compliance with certain standards contained in 40 CFR part 87. If EPA takes any action, including the issuance of an exemption or issuance of a revised or alternate procedure, test method, or other regulation, the effect of which is to relax or delay the effective date of any provision of 40 CFR part 87 that is made applicable to an aircraft under this FAR, the Administrator of FAA will grant a general administrative waiver of its more stringent requirements until this FAR is amended to reflect the more relaxed requirements prescribed by EPA.

\(g\) Unless otherwise stated, all terminology and abbreviations in this FAR that are defined in 40 CFR part 87 have the meaning specified in that part, and all terms in 40 CFR part 87 that are not defined in that part but that are used in this FAR have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 91-604.

\(h\) All interpretations of 40 CFR part 87 that are rendered by the EPA also apply to this FAR.

\(i\) If the EPA, under 40 CFR 87.3(a), approves or accepts any testing and sampling procedures or methods, analytical techniques, or related equipment not identical to those specified in that part, this FAR requires an applicant to show that such alternate, equivalent, or otherwise nonidentical procedures have been complied with, and that such alternate equipment was used to show compliance, unless the applicant elects to comply with those procedures, methods, techniques, and equipment specified in 40 CFR part 87.

\(j\) If the EPA, under 40 CFR 87.5, prescribes special test procedures for any aircraft or aircraft engine that is not susceptible to satisfactory testing by the procedures in 40 CFR part 87, the applicant must show the Administrator that those special test procedures have been complied with.

\(k\) Wherever 40 CFR part 87 requires agreement, acceptance, or approval by the Administrator of the EPA, this FAR requires a showing that such agreement or approval has been obtained.

\(l\) Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7573, no state or political subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any standard respecting emissions of any air pollutant from any aircraft or engine thereof unless that standard is identical to a standard made applicable to the aircraft by the terms of this FAR.

\(m\) If EPA, by regulation or exemption, relaxes a provision of 40 CFR part 87 that is implemented in this FAR, no state or political subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce the terms of this FAR that are superseded by the relaxed requirement.

\(n\) If any provision of this FAR is rendered inapplicable to a foreign aircraft as provided in 40 CFR 87.3(c) (international agreements), and [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0034 Fuel venting and exhaust emission requirements for turbine engine powered airplanes#§34.3   General requirements.\|§34.3]](d) of this FAR, that provision may not be adopted or enforced against that foreign aircraft by a state or political subdivision thereof.

\(o\) For exhaust emissions requirements of this FAR that apply beginning February 1, 1974, January 1, 1976, January 1, 1978, January 1, 1984, and August 9, 1985, continued compliance with those requirements is shown for engines for which the type design has been shown to meet those requirements, if the engine is maintained in accordance with applicable maintenance requirements for 14 CFR chapter I. All methods of demonstrating compliance and all model designations previously found acceptable to the Administrator shall be deemed to continue to be an acceptable demonstration of compliance with the specific standards for which they were approved.

\(p\) Each applicant must allow the Administrator to make, or witness, any test necessary to determine compliance with the applicable provisions of this FAR.

\[Doc. No. 25613, 55 FR 32861, Aug. 10, 1990; 55 FR 37287, Sept. 10, 1990; Amdt. 34-5, 77 FR 76850, Dec. 31, 2012\]

### §34.4   \[Reserved\]

### §34.5   Special test procedures.

The Administrator or the Administrator of the EPA may, upon written application by a manufacturer or operator of aircraft or aircraft engines, approve test procedures for any aircraft or aircraft engine that is not susceptible to satisfactory testing by the procedures set forth herein. Prior to taking action on any such application, the Administrator or the Administrator of the EPA shall consult with the other.

### §34.6   Aircraft safety.

\(a\) The provisions of this part will be revised if at any time the Administrator determines that an emission standard cannot be met within the specified time without creating a safety hazard.

\(b\) Consistent with 40 CFR 87.6, if the FAA Administrator determines that any emission control regulation in this part cannot be safely applied to an aircraft, that provision may not be adopted or enforced against that aircraft by any state or political subdivision thereof.

### §34.7   Exemptions.

Notwithstanding part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations ([[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0011 General rulemaking procedures\|14 CFR part 11]]), all petitions for rulemaking involving either the substance of an emission standard or test procedure prescribed by the EPA that is incorporated in this FAR, or the compliance date for such standard or procedure, must be submitted to the EPA. Information copies of such petitions are invited by the FAA. Petitions for rulemaking or exemption involving provisions of this FAR that do not affect the substance or the compliance date of an emission standard or test procedure that is prescribed by the EPA, and petitions for exemptions under the provisions for which the EPA has specifically granted exemption authority to the Secretary of Transportation are subject to part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations ([[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0011 General rulemaking procedures\|14 CFR part 11]]). Petitions for rulemaking or exemptions involving these FARs must be submitted to the FAA.

\(a\) *Exemptions based on flights for short durations at infrequent intervals.* The emission standards of this part do not apply to engines which power aircraft operated in the United States for short durations at infrequent intervals. Such operations are limited to:

\(1\) Flights of an aircraft for the purpose of export to a foreign country, including any flights essential to demonstrate the integrity of an aircraft prior to a flight to a point outside the United States.

\(2\) Flights to a base where repairs, alterations or maintenance are to be performed, or to a point of storage, or for the purpose of returning an aircraft to service.

\(3\) Official visits by representatives of foreign governments.

\(4\) Other flights the Administrator determines, after consultation with the Administrator of the EPA, to be for short durations at infrequent intervals. A request for such a determination shall be made before the flight takes place.

\(b\) *Exemptions for very low production engine models.* The emissions standards of this part do not apply to engines of very low production after the date of applicability. For the purpose of this part, “very low production” is limited to a maximum total production for United States civil aviation applications of no more than 200 units covered by the same type certificate after January 1, 1984. Engines manufactured under this provision must be reported to the FAA by serial number on or before the date of manufacture and exemptions granted under this provision are not transferable to any other engine. This exemption is limited to the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0034 Fuel venting and exhaust emission requirements for turbine engine powered airplanes#§34.21   Standards for exhaust emissions.\|§34.21]] only.

\(c\) *Exemptions for new engines in other categories.* The emissions standards of this part do not apply to engines for which the Administrator determines, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the EPA, that application of any standard under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0034 Fuel venting and exhaust emission requirements for turbine engine powered airplanes#§34.21   Standards for exhaust emissions.\|§34.21]] is not justified, based upon consideration of—

\(1\) Adverse economic impact on the manufacturer;

\(2\) Adverse economic impact on the aircraft and airline industries at large;

\(3\) Equity in administering the standards among all economically competing parties;

\(4\) Public health and welfare effects; and

\(5\) Other factors which the Administrator, after consultation with the Administrator of the EPA, may deem relevant to the case in question.

\(d\) *Applicants seeking exemption from other emissions standards of this part and 40 CFR part 87.* Applicants must request exemption from both the FAA and the EPA, even where the underlying regulatory requirements are the same. The FAA and EPA will jointly consider such exemption requests, and will assure consistency in the respective agency determinations.

\(e\) Applications for exemption from this part shall be submitted in duplicate to the Administrator in accordance with the procedures established by the Administrator in part 11.

\(f\) The Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the name of the organization to whom exemptions are granted and the period of such exemptions.

\(g\) No state or political subdivision thereof may attempt to enforce a standard respecting emissions from an aircraft or engine if such aircraft or engine has been exempted from such standard under this part.

\[Doc. No. 25613, 55 FR 32861, Aug. 10, 1990, as amended by Amdt. 34-5, 77 FR 76850, Dec. 31, 2012\]

### §34.9   Exceptions.

\(a\) *Spare engines.* Certain engines that meet the following description are excepted:

\(1\) This exception allows production of an engine for installation on an in-service aircraft. A spare engine may not be installed on a new aircraft.

\(2\) Each spare engine must be identical to a sub-model previously certificated to meet all applicable requirements.

\(3\) A spare engine may be used only when the emissions of the spare do not exceed the certification requirements of the original engine, for all regulated pollutants.

\(4\) No separate approval is required to produce spare engines.

\(5\) The record for each engine excepted under this paragraph (c) must indicate that the engine was produced as an excepted spare engine.

\(6\) Engines produced under this exception must be labeled “EXCEPTED SPARE” in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0045 Identification and registration marking#§45.13   Identification data.\|§45.13]] of this chapter.

\(b\) On and after July 18, 2012, and before August 31, 2013, a manufacturer may produce up to six Tier 4 compliant engines that meet the NOX standards of paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section rather than [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0034 Fuel venting and exhaust emission requirements for turbine engine powered airplanes#§34.23   Exhaust Emission Standards for Engines Manufactured on and after July 18, 2012.\|§34.23]](a)(2). No separate approval is required to produce these engines.

## Subpart E—Certification Provisions

### §34.48   Derivative engines for emissions certification purposes.

\(a\) *General.* A derivative engine for emissions certification purposes is an engine configuration that is determined to be similar in design to a previously certificated (original) engine for purposes of compliance with exhaust emissions standards (gaseous and smoke). A type certificate holder may request from the FAA a determination that an engine configuration is considered a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes. To be considered a derivative engine for emission purposes under this part, the configuration must have been derived from the original engine that was certificated to the requirements of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0033 Airworthiness standards  aircraft engines\|part 33 of this chapter]] and one of the following:

\(1\) The FAA has determined that a safety issue exists that requires an engine modification.

\(2\) Emissions from the derivative engines are determined to be similar. In general, this means the emissions must meet the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The FAA may amend the criteria of paragraph (b) in unusual circumstances, for individual cases, consistent with good engineering judgment.

\(3\) All of the regulated emissions from the derivative engine are lower than the original engine.

\(b\) *Emissions similarity.* (1) The type certificate holder must demonstrate that the proposed derivative engine model's emissions meet the applicable standards and differ from the original model's emission rates only within the following ranges:

\(i\) ±3.0 g/kN for NOX.

\(ii\) ±1.0 g/kN for HC.

\(iii\) ±5.0 g/kN for CO.

\(iv\) ±2.0 SN for smoke.

\(2\) If the characteristic level of the original certificated engine model (or any other sub-models within the emission type certificate family tested for certification) before modification is at or above 95% of the applicable standard for any pollutant, an applicant must measure the proposed derivative engine model's emissions for all pollutants to demonstrate that the derivative engine's resulting characteristic levels will not exceed the applicable emission standards. If the characteristic levels of the originally certificated engine model (and all other sub-models within the emission type certificate family tested for certification) are below 95% of the applicable standard for each pollutant, the applicant may use engineering analysis consistent with good engineering judgment to demonstrate that the derivative engine will not exceed the applicable emission standards. The engineering analysis must address all modifications from the original engine, including those approved for previous derivative engines.

\(c\) *Continued production allowance.* Derivative engines for emissions certification purposes may continue to be produced after the applicability date for new emissions standards when the engines conform to the specifications of this section.

\(d\) *Non-derivative engines.* If the FAA determines that an engine model does not meet the requirements for a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes, the type certificate holder is required to demonstrate that the engine complies with the emissions standards applicable to a new engine type.

## Subpart F \[Reserved\]

## Subpart G—Test Procedures for Engine Exhaust Gaseous Emissions (Aircraft and Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines)

### §34.60   Introduction.

\(a\) Use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 3, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16, as applicable, to demonstrate whether engines meet the applicable gaseous emission standards specified in subpart C of this part. Measure the emissions of all regulated gaseous pollutants. Use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 2 and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16 to determine whether engines meet the applicable smoke standard specified in subpart C of this part. The compliance demonstration consists of establishing a mean value from testing the specified number of engines, then calculating a “characteristic level” by applying a set of statistical factors that take into account the number of engines tested. Round each characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding emission standard. For turboprop engines, use the procedures specified for turbofan engines, consistent with good engineering judgment.

\(b\) Use a test fuel that meets the specifications described in Appendix 4 of ICAO Annex 16. The test fuel must not have additives whose purpose is to suppress smoke, such as organometallic compounds.

\(c\) Prepare test engines by including accessories that are available with production engines if they can reasonably be expected to influence emissions. The test engine may not extract shaft power or bleed service air to provide power to auxiliary gearbox-mounted components required to drive aircraft systems.

\(d\) Test engines must reach a steady operating temperature before the start of emission measurements.

\(e\) In consultation with the EPA, the FAA may approve alternative procedures for measuring emissions, including testing and sampling methods, analytical techniques, and equipment specifications that differ from those specified in this part. Manufacturers and operators may request approval of alternative procedures by written request with supporting justification to the FAA and to the Designated EPA Program Officer. To be approved, one of the following conditions must be met:

\(1\) The engine cannot be tested using the specified procedures; or

\(2\) The alternative procedure is shown to be equivalent to, or more accurate or precise than, the specified procedure.

\(f\) The following landing and takeoff (LTO) cycles apply for emissions testing and for calculating weighted LTO values:

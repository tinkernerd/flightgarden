\(c\) *Width.* Characters must be two-thirds as wide as they are high, except the number “1”, which must be one-sixth as wide as it is high, and the letters “M” and “W” which may be as wide as they are high.

\(d\) *Thickness.* Characters must be formed by solid lines one-sixth as thick as the character is high.

\(e\) *Spacing.* The space between each character may not be less than one-fourth of the character width.

\(f\) If either one of the surfaces authorized for displaying required marks under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0045 Identification and registration marking#§45.25   Location of marks on fixed-wing aircraft.\|§45.25]] is large enough for display of marks meeting the size requirements of this section and the other is not, full size marks must be placed on the larger surface. If neither surface is large enough for full-size marks, marks as large as practicable must be displayed on the larger of the two surfaces. If no surface authorized to be marked by [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0045 Identification and registration marking#§45.27   Location of marks; nonfixed-wing aircraft.\|§45.27]] is large enough for full-size marks, marks as large as practicable must be placed on the largest of the authorized surfaces. However, powered parachutes and weight-shift-control aircraft must display marks at least 3 inches high.

\(g\) *Uniformity.* The marks required by this part for fixed-wing aircraft must have the same height, width, thickness, and spacing on both sides of the aircraft.

\(h\) After March 7, 1988, each operator of an aircraft penetrating an ADIZ or DEWIZ must display on that aircraft temporary or permanent nationality and registration marks at least 12 inches high.

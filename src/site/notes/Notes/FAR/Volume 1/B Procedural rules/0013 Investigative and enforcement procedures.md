### §13.15   Civil penalties: Other than by administrative assessment.

\(a\) The FAA uses the procedures in this section when it seeks a civil penalty other than by the administrative assessment procedures in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.16   Civil Penalties: Administrative assessment against a person other than an individual acting as a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman.

The civil penalty letter contains a statement of the charges, the applicable law, rule, regulation, or order, the amount of civil penalty that the Administrator will accept in full settlement of the action or an offer to compromise the civil penalty.

\(2\) Not later than 30 days after receipt of the civil penalty letter, the person charged with a violation may present any material or information in answer to the charges to the agency attorney, either orally or in writing, that may explain, mitigate, or deny the violation or that may show extenuating circumstances.

\(5\) If the parties cannot agree to compromise the civil penalty action or the offer to compromise is rejected and the certified check or money order submitted in compromise is returned, the Administrator may refer the civil penalty action to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate of the Attorney General, to begin proceedings in a United States district court, pursuant to the authority in 49 U.S.C. 46305, to prosecute and collect the civil penalty.

\[Amdt. 13-18, 53 FR 34653, Sept. 7, 1988, as amended by Amdt. 13-20, 55 FR 15128, Apr. 20, 1990; Amdt. 13-29, 62 FR 46865, Sept. 4, 1997; Amdt. 13-32; 69 FR 59495, Oct. 4, 2004\]

\(4\) Unless a petition for review is filed with a U.S. Court of Appeals in a timely manner, a final decision and order of the Administrator shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the FAA decisionmaker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil penalty is warranted.

\(e\) *Delegation of authority.* (1) The authority of the Administrator under 49 U.S.C. 46301(d), 47531, and 5123, and 49 CFR 1.47(k) to initiate and assess civil penalties for a violation of those statutes or a rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, is delegated to the Deputy Chief Counsel for Operations; the Assistant Chief Counsel for Enforcement; the Assistant Chief Counsel, Europe, Africa, and Middle East Area Office; the Regional Counsel; the Aeronautical Center Counsel; and the Technical Center Counsel.

\(1\) A final notice of proposed civil penalty may be issued—

\(i\) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty within 30 days after receipt of that notice; or

The procedural rules in subpart G of this part apply to the hearing and any appeal. At the close of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall issue, either orally on the record or in writing, an initial decision, including the reasons for the decision, that contains findings or conclusions on the allegations contained, and the civil penalty sought, in the complaint.

\(j\) *Appeal.* Either party may appeal the administrative law judge's initial decision to the FAA decisionmaker pursuant to the procedures in subpart G of this part. If a party files a notice of appeal pursuant to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.233   Appeal from initial decision.\|§13.233]] of subpart G, the effectiveness of the initial decision is stayed until a final decision and order of the Administrator have been entered on the record.

\(k\) *Payment.* A person shall pay a civil penalty by sending a certified check or money order, payable to the Federal Aviation Administration, to the agency attorney.

\(l\) *Collection of civil penalties.* If an individual does not pay a civil penalty imposed by an order assessing civil penalty or other final order, the Administrator may take action provided under the law to collect the penalty.

\(m\) A party may seek review only of a final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker involving a violation of the Federal aviation statute or the Federal hazardous materials transportation law. Judicial review is in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the party resides or has the party's principal place of business as provided in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.235   Judicial review of a final decision and order.\|§13.235]] of this part. Neither an initial decision or an order issued by an administrative law judge that has not been appealed to the FAA decisionmaker, nor an order compromising a civil penalty action, may be appealed under any of those sections.

\(n\) *Compromise.* The FAA may compromise the amount of any civil penalty imposed under this section, under 49 U.S.C. 5123(e), 46031(f), 46303(b), or 46318 at any time before referring the action to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate of the Attorney General, for collection.

\(1\) An agency attorney may compromise any civil penalty action where a person charged with a violation agrees to pay a civil penalty and the FAA agrees not to make a finding of violation. Under such agreement, a compromise order is issued following the payment of the agreed-on amount or the signing of a promissory note. The compromise order states the following:

\(i\) The person has paid a civil penalty or has signed a promissory note providing for installment payments.

\(ii\) The FAA makes no finding of a violation.

\(iii\) The compromise order shall not be used as evidence of a prior violation in any subsequent civil penalty proceeding or certificate action proceeding.

### §13.19   Certificate action.

\(a\) Under section 609 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1429), the Administrator may reinspect any civil aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, air navigation facility, or air agency, and may re-examine any civil airman. Under section 501(e) of the FA Act, any Certificate of Aircraft Registration may be suspended or revoked by the Administrator for any cause that renders the aircraft ineligible for registration.

\(b\) If, as a result of such a reinspection re-examination, or other investigation made by the Administrator under section 609 of the FA Act, the Administrator determines that the public interest and safety in air commerce requires it, the Administrator may issue an order amending, suspending, or revoking, all or part of any type certificate, production certificate, airworthiness certificate, airman certificate, air carrier operating certificate, air navigation facility certificate, or air agency certificate. This authority may be exercised for remedial purposes in cases involving the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1801 *et seq.*) or regulations issued under that Act. This authority is also exercised by the Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Enforcement, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Regulations, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Europe, Africa, and Middle East Area Office, each Regional Counsel, and the Aeronautical Center Counsel. If the Administrator finds that any aircraft registered under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration\|Part 47 of this chapter]] is ineligible for registration, the Administrator issues an order suspending or revoking that certificate. This authority as to aircraft found ineligible for registration is also exercised by each Regional Counsel, the Aeronautical Center Counsel, and the Assistant Chief Counsel, Europe, Africa, and Middle East Area Office.

\(c\) Before issuing an order under paragraph (b) of this section, the Chief Counsel, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Enforcement, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Regulations, the Assistant Chief Counsel, Europe, Africa, and Middle East Area Office, each Regional Counsel, or the Aeronautical Center Counsel advises the certificate holder of the charges or other reasons upon which the Administrator bases the proposed action and, except in an emergency, allows the holder to answer any charges and to be heard as to why the certificate should not be amended, suspended, or revoked. The holder may, by checking the appropriate box on the form that is sent to the holder with the notice of proposed certificate action, elect to—

\(1\) Admit the charges and surrender his or her certificate;

\(2\) Answer the charges in writing;

\(3\) Request that an order be issued in accordance with the notice of proposed certificate action so that the certificate holder may appeal to the National Transportation Safety Board, if the charges concerning a matter under Title VI of the FA Act;

\(4\) Request an opportunity to be heard in an informal conference with the FAA counsel; or

\(5\) Request a hearing in accordance with Subpart D of this part if the charges concern a matter under Title V of the FA Act.

\(d\) Any person whose certificate is affected by an order issued under this section may appeal to the National Transportation Safety Board. If the certificate holder files an appeal with the Board, the Administrator's order is stayed unless the Administrator advises the Board that an emergency exists and safety in air commerce requires that the order become effective immediately. If the Board is so advised, the order remains effective and the Board shall finally dispose of the appeal within 60 days after the date of the advice. This paragraph does not apply to any person whose Certificate of Aircraft Registration is affected by an order issued under this section.

\(e\) Failure to request a hearing within the period provided in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section—

\(1\) Constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal and the right to a hearing, and

\(2\) Authorizes the official who issued the notice to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice, or as modified as the official may determine necessary based on any written response, and to issue an appropriate order, without further notice or proceedings.

\(i\) Any person filing an appeal authorized by paragraph (g) of this section shall file an appeal brief with the Administrator within 40 days after the date of issuance of the order, and serve a copy on the other party. A reply brief must be filed within 20 days after service of the appeal brief and a copy served on the appellant.

\(j\) On appeal the Administrator reviews the available record of the proceeding, and issues an order dismissing, reversing, modifying or affirming the order. The Administrator's order includes the reasons for the Administrator's action.

\(k\) For good cause shown, requests for extensions of time to file any document under this section may be granted by—

\(1\) The official who issued the order, if the request is filed prior to the designation of a Hearing Officer; or

\(2\) The Hearing Officer, if the request is filed prior to the filing of a notice of appeal; or

\(3\) The Administrator, if the request is filed after the filing of a notice of appeal.

\(l\) Except in the case of an appeal from the decision of a Hearing Officer, the authority of the Administrator under this section is also exercised by the Chief Counsel, Deputy Chief Counsel, each Assistant Chief Counsel, each Regional Counsel, and the Aeronautical Center Counsel (as to matters under Title V of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958).

\(m\) Filing and service of documents under this section shall be accomplished in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.43   Service and filing of pleadings, motions, and documents.\|§13.43]]; and the periods of time specified in this section shall be computed in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.44   Computation of time and extension of time.\|§13.44]].

Subtitle VII and the FAA's regulations by individuals presenting dangerous or deadly weapons for screening at airport checkpoints or in checked baggage. This authority may not be delegated below the level of the regional Civil Aviation Security Deputy Division Manager.

\(b\) *Notice of violation.* A civil penalty action is initiated by sending a notice of violation to the person charged with the violation. The notice of violation contains a statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice of violation, the person charged with a violation shall:

\(3\) Request a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket clerk.

\(c\) *Final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order.* A final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order (“final notice and order”) may be issued after participation in any informal proceedings as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or after failure of the respondent to respond in a timely manner to a notice of violation. A final notice and order will be sent to the individual charged with a violation. The final notice and order will contain a statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty and, as a result of information submitted to the agency attorney during any informal procedures, may reflect a modified allegation or proposed civil penalty.

A final notice and order may be issued—

\(1\) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the notice of violation within 30 days after receipt of that notice; or

\(2\) If the parties participated in any informal procedures under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the parties have not agreed to compromise the action or the agency attorney has not agreed to withdraw the notice of violation.

\(d\) *Order assessing civil penalty.* An order assessing civil penalty may be issued after notice and opportunity for a hearing. A person charged with a violation may be subject to an order assessing civil penalty in the following circumstances:

\(1\) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit, the amount of civil penalty proposed in the notice of violation.

\(2\) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit, an agreed-upon amount of civil penalty that is not reflected in either the notice of violation or the final notice and order.

\(3\) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty when the person charged with a violation submits the amount of the proposed civil penalty that is reflected in the final notice and order.

\(4\) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty 16 days after receipt of the final notice and order, *unless* not later than 15 days after receipt of the final notice and order, the person charged with a violation does one of the following—

\(ii\) Requests a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket clerk.

\(5\) Unless an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker in a timely manner, an initial decision or order of an administrative law judge shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if an administrative law judge finds that an alleged violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found to be appropriate by the administrative law judge, is warranted.

\(6\) Unless a petition for review is filed with a U.S. Court of Appeals in a timely manner, a final decision and order of the Administrator shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the FAA decisionmaker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil penalty is warranted.

### §13.219   Interlocutory appeals.

\(a\) *General.* Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may not appeal a ruling or decision of the administrative law judge to the FAA decisionmaker until the initial decision has been entered on the record. A decision or order of the FAA decisionmaker on the interlocutory appeal does not constitute a final order of the Administrator for the purposes of judicial appellate review as provided in [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.235   Judicial review of a final decision and order.\|§13.235]] of this subpart.

\(b\) *Interlocutory appeal for cause.* If a party files a written request for an interlocutory appeal for cause with the administrative law judge, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the proceedings are stayed until the administrative law judge issues a decision on the request. If the administrative law judge grants the request, the proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The administrative law judge shall grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that delay of the appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would result in undue prejudice to any party.

\(c\) *Interlocutory appeals of right.* If a party notifies the administrative law judge of an interlocutory appeal of right, the proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal with the FAA decisionmaker, without the consent of the administrative law judge, before an initial decision has been entered in the case of:

\(1\) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge barring a person from the proceedings.

\(2\) Failure of the administrative law judge to dismiss the proceedings in accordance with [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.215   Withdrawal of complaint or request for hearing.\|§13.215]] of this subpart.

\(3\) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge in violation of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.205   Administrative law judges.\|§13.205]](b) of this subpart.

\(d\) *Procedure.* A party shall file a notice of interlocutory appeal, with supporting documents, with the FAA decisionmaker and the hearing docket clerk, and shall serve a copy of the notice and supporting documents on each party and the administrative law judge, not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of right or not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's decision granting an interlocutory appeal for cause, whichever is appropriate. A party shall file a reply brief, if any, with the FAA decisionmaker and serve a copy of the reply brief on each party, not later than 10 days after service of the appeal brief. The FAA decisionmaker shall render a decision on the interlocutory appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in the proceedings, within a reasonable time after receipt of the interlocutory appeal.

\(e\) The FAA decisionmaker may reject frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one or more parties from making further interlocutory appeals in a proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory interlocutory appeals.

\[Amdt. 13-21, 55 FR 27575, July 3, 1990, as amended by Amdt. 13-23, 55 FR 45983, Oct. 31, 1990; 71 FR 70464, Dec. 5, 2006\]

### §13.220   Discovery.

\(a\) *Initiation of discovery.* Any party may initiate discovery described in this section, without the consent or approval of the administrative law judge, at any time after a complaint has been filed in the proceedings.

\(b\) *Methods of discovery.* The following methods of discovery are permitted under this section: depositions on oral examination or written questions of any person; written interrogatories directed to a party; requests for production of documents or tangible items to any person; and requests for admission by a party. A party is not required to file written interrogatories and responses, requests for production of documents or tangible items and responses, and requests for admission and response with the administrative law judge or the hearing docket clerk. In the event of a discovery dispute, a party shall attach a copy of these documents in support of a motion made under this section.

\(c\) *Service on the agency.* A party shall serve each discovery request directed to the agency or any agency employee on the agency attorney of record.

\(d\) *Time for response to discovery requests.* Unless otherwise directed by this subpart or agreed by the parties, a party shall respond to a request for discovery, including filing objections to a request for discovery, not later than 30 days of service of the request.

\(e\) *Scope of discovery.* Subject to the limits on discovery set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, a party may discover any matter that is not privileged and that is relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding. A party may discover information that relates to the claim or defense of any party including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any document or other tangible item and the identity and location of any person having knowledge of discoverable matter. A party may discover facts known, or opinions held, by an expert who any other party expects to call to testify at the hearing. A party has no ground to object to a discovery request on the basis that the information sought would not be admissible at the hearing if the information sought during discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

\(f\) *Limiting discovery.* The administrative law judge shall limit the frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party shows that—

\(1\) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;

\(2\) The information requested can be obtained from another less burdensome and more convenient source;

\(3\) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted under this section; or

\(4\) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is unduly burdensome or expensive.

\(g\) *Confidential orders.* A party or person who has received a discovery request for information that is related to a trade secret, confidential or sensitive material, competitive or commercial information, proprietary data, or information on research and development, may file a motion for a confidential order with the administrative law judge and shall serve a copy of the motion for a confidential order on each party.

\(1\) The party or person making the motion must show that the confidential order is necessary to protect the information from disclosure to the public.

\(2\) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested material is not necessary to decide the case, the administrative law judge shall preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.

\(3\) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested material may be disclosed during discovery, the administrative law judge may order that the material may be discovered and disclosed under limited conditions or may be used only under certain terms and conditions.

\(4\) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested material is necessary to decide the case and that a confidential order is warranted, the administrative law judge shall provide:

\(i\) An opportunity for review of the document by the parties off the record;

\(ii\) Procedures for excluding the information from the record; and

\(iii\) Order that the parties shall not disclose the information in any manner and the parties shall not use the information in any other proceeding.

\(h\) *Protective orders.* A party or a person who has received a request for discovery may file a motion for protective order with the administrative law judge and shall serve a copy of the motion for protective order on each party. The party or person making the motion must show that the protective order is necessary to protect the party or the person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. As part of the protective order, the administrative law judge may:

\(1\) Deny the discovery request;

\(2\) Order that discovery be conducted only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place for discovery or a determination of the method of discovery; or

\(3\) Limit the scope of discovery or preclude any inquiry into certain matters during discovery.

\(i\) *Duty to supplement or amend responses.* A party who has responded to a discovery request has a duty to supplement or amend the response, as soon as the information is known, as follows:

\(1\) A party shall supplement or amend any response to a question requesting the identity and location of any person having knowledge of discoverable matters.

\(2\) A party shall supplement or amend any response to a question requesting the identity of each person who will be called to testify at the hearing as an expert witness and the subject matter and substance of that witness' testimony.

\(3\) A party shall supplement or amend any response that was incorrect when made or any response that was correct when made but is no longer correct, accurate, or complete.

\(j\) *Depositions.* The following rules apply to depositions taken pursuant to this section:

\(1\) *Form.* A deposition shall be taken on the record and reduced to writing. The person being deposed shall sign the deposition unless the parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.

\(2\) *Administration of oaths.* Within the United States, or a territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, a party shall take a deposition before a person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the law of the place where the examination is held. In foreign countries, a party shall take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

\(3\) *Notice of deposition.* A party shall serve a notice of deposition, stating the time and place of the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, on the person to be deposed, on the administrative law judge, on the hearing docket clerk, and on each party not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may serve a notice of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only with consent of the administrative law judge. If a subpoena *duces tecum* is to be served on the person to be examined, the party shall attach a copy of the subpoena *duces tecum* that describes the materials to be produced at the deposition to the notice of deposition.

\(4\) *Use of depositions.* A party may use any part or all of a deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable notice of the deposition.

\(k\) *Interrogatories.* A party, the party's attorney, or the party's representative may sign the party's responses to interrogatories. A party shall answer each interrogatory separately and completely in writing. If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party shall state the objection and the reasons for the objection. An opposing party may use any part or all of a party's responses to interrogatories at a hearing authorized under this subpart to the extent that the response is relevant, material, and not repetitious.

\(1\) A party shall not serve more than 30 interrogatories to each other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory shall be counted as a separate interrogatory.

\(2\) A party shall file a motion for leave to serve additional interrogatories on a party with the administrative law judge before serving additional interrogatories on a party. The administrative law judge shall grant the motion only if the party shows good cause for the party's failure to inquire about the information previously and that the information cannot reasonably be obtained using less burdensome discovery methods or be obtained from other sources.

\(l\) *Requests for admission.* A party may serve a written request for admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under this section or the authenticity of any document described in the request. A party shall set forth each request for admission separately. A party shall serve copies of documents referenced in the request for admission unless the documents have been provided or are reasonably available for inspection and copying.

\(1\) *Time.* A party's failure to respond to a request for admission, in writing and signed by the attorney or the party, not later than 30 days after service of the request, is deemed an admission of the truth of the statement or statements contained in the request for admission. The administrative law judge may determine that a failure to respond to a request for admission is not deemed an admission of the truth if a party shows that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the control of the party or the party's attorney.

\(2\) *Response.* A party may object to a request for admission and shall state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the truth of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or admit the truth of the matter, the party shall show that the party has made reasonable inquiry into the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. If the administrative law judge determines that a response does not comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is insufficient, the matter is deemed admitted.

\(3\) *Effect of admission.* Any matter admitted or deemed admitted under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the hearing and appeal.

\(m\) *Motion to compel discovery.* A party may make a motion to compel discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, if a person gives an evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding to an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before making a motion to compel if a person refuses to answer.

\(n\) *Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel.* If a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, the administrative law judge, limited to the extent of the party's failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may:

\(1\) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings;

\(2\) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party;

\(3\) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the hearing; or

\(4\) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses at the hearing.

The administrative law judge shall admit any oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence introduced by a party but shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.

\(c\) *Hearsay evidence.* Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings governed by this subpart. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its admissibility.

### §13.223   Standard of proof.

The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision or shall rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is supported by, and in accordance with, the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence contained in the record.

The party shall state the specific grounds for nondisclosure in the motion.

\(b\) The administrative law judge shall grant the motion to withhold information in the record if, based on the motion and any response to the motion, the administrative law judge determines that disclosure would be detrimental to aviation safety, disclosure would not be in the public interest, or that the information is not otherwise required to be made available to the public.

### §13.227   Expert or opinion witnesses.

An employee of the agency may not be called as an expert or opinion witness, for any party other than the FAA, in any proceeding governed by this subpart. An employee of a respondent may not be called by an agency attorney as an expert or opinion witness for the FAA in any proceeding governed by this subpart to which the respondent is a party.

### §13.228   Subpoenas.

\(a\) *Request for subpoena.* A party may obtain a subpoena to compel the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing or to require the production of documents or tangible items from the hearing docket clerk. The hearing docket clerk shall deliver the subpoena, signed by the hearing docket clerk or an administrative law judge but otherwise in blank, to the party. The party shall complete the subpoena, stating the title of the action and the date and time for the witness' attendance or production of documents or items. The party who obtained the subpoena shall serve the subpoena on the witness.

\(b\) *Motion to quash or modify the subpoena.* A party, or any person upon whom a subpoena has been served, may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the administrative law judge at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance.

A motion to quash or modify the subpoena will stay the effect of the subpoena pending a decision by the administrative law judge on the motion.

\(c\) *Enforcement of subpoena.* Upon a showing that a person has failed or refused to comply with a subpoena, a party may apply to the local federal district court to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46104 in cases under the Federal aviation statute.

The administrative law judge shall give the parties a reasonable opportunity, not more than 30 days after receipt of the transcript, to prepare and submit the briefs.

### §13.232   Initial decision.

\(a\) *Contents.* The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision at the conclusion of the hearing.

The administrative law judge is not required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the substance of the initial decision. If the administrative law judge refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the administrative law judge shall make copies of that initial decision available to all parties and the FAA decisionmaker.

\(b\) *Oral decision.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, at the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall issue the initial decision and order orally on the record.

\(c\) *Written decision.* The administrative law judge may issue a written initial decision not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing or submission of the last posthearing brief if the administrative law judge finds that issuing a written initial decision is reasonable. The administrative law judge shall serve a copy of any written initial decision on each party.

\(d\) *Order assessing civil penalty.* Unless appealed pursuant to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.233   Appeal from initial decision.\|§13.233]] of this subpart, the initial decision issued by the administrative law judge shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the administrative law judge finds that an alleged violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found appropriate by the administrative law judge, is warranted.

### §13.233   Appeal from initial decision.

\(a\) *Notice of appeal.* A party may appeal the initial decision, and any decision not previously appealed pursuant to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.219   Interlocutory appeals.\|§13.219]], by filing a notice of appeal with the FAA decisionmaker.

\(b\) *Issues on appeal.* In any appeal from a decision of an administrative law judge, the FAA decisionmaker considers only the following issues:

\(1\) Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence;

\(2\) Whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with applicable law, precedent, and public policy; and

\(3\) Whether the administrative law judge committed any prejudicial errors that support the appeal.

\(c\) *Perfecting an appeal.* Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party shall perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief with the FAA decisionmaker.

\(1\) *Extension of time by agreement of the parties.* The parties may agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of the FAA decisionmaker. If the FAA decisionmaker grants an extension of time to perfect the appeal, the appellate docket clerk shall serve a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.

\(2\) *Written motion for extension.* If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the FAA decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the motion on each party.

\(d\) *Appeal briefs.* A party shall file the appeal brief with the FAA decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the appeal brief on each party.

\(1\) A party shall set forth, in detail, the party's specific objections to the initial decision or rulings in the appeal brief.

\(e\) *Reply brief.* Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party may file a reply brief with the FAA decisionmaker not later than 35 days after the appeal brief has been served on that party. The party filing the reply brief shall serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the reply, the party shall specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in the transcript in the reply brief.

\(1\) *Extension of time by agreement of the parties.* The parties may agree to extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of the FAA decisionmaker. If the FAA decisionmaker grants an extension of time to file the reply brief, the appellate docket clerk shall serve a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.

\(2\) *Written motion for extension.* If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the FAA decisionmaker and shall serve a copy of the motion on each party.

A party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief. A party may petition the FAA decisionmaker, in writing, for leave to file an additional brief and shall serve a copy of the petition on each party.

\(g\) *Number of copies.* A party shall file the original appeal brief or the original reply brief, and two copies of the brief, with the FAA decisionmaker.

\(h\) *Oral argument.* The FAA decisionmaker has sole discretion to permit oral argument on the appeal. On the FAA decisionmaker's own initiative or upon written motion by any party, the FAA decisionmaker may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an opportunity for oral argument.

\(i\) *Waiver of objections on appeal.* If a party fails to object to any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The FAA decisionmaker is not required to consider any objection in an appeal brief or any argument in the reply brief if a party's objection is based on evidence contained on the record and the party does not specifically refer to the pertinent evidence from the record in the brief.

\(j\) *FAA decisionmaker's decision on appeal.* The FAA decisionmaker will review the record, the briefs on appeal, and the oral argument, if any, when considering the issues on appeal. The FAA decisionmaker may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, make any necessary findings, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the FAA decisionmaker determines may be necessary.

\(1\) The FAA decisionmaker may raise any issue, on the FAA decisionmaker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition of the proceedings. The FAA decisionmaker will give the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues before making a decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker requires the consideration of additional testimony or evidence, the FAA decisionmaker will remand the case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings and an initial decision related to that issue. If an issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker is solely an issue of law or the issue was addressed at the hearing but was not raised by a party in the briefs on appeal, a remand of the case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings is not required but may be provided in the discretion of the FAA decisionmaker.

\(2\) The FAA decisionmaker will issue the final decision and order of the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the decision and order on each party. Unless a petition for review is filed pursuant to [[Notes/FAR/Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0013 Investigative and enforcement procedures#§13.235   Judicial review of a final decision and order.\|§13.235]], a final decision and order of the Administrator shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the FAA decisionmaker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil penalty is warranted.

\(3\) A final decision and order of the Administrator after appeal is precedent in any other civil penalty action. Any issue, finding or conclusion, order, ruling, or initial decision of an administrative law judge that has not been appealed to the FAA decisionmaker is not precedent in any other civil penalty action.

## Subpart I—Flight Operational Quality Assurance Programs

### §13.401   Flight Operational Quality Assurance Program: Prohibition against use of data for enforcement purposes.

\(a\) *Applicability.* This section applies to any operator of an aircraft who operates such aircraft under an approved Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) program.

\(b\) *Definitions.* For the purpose of this section, the terms—

\(1\) *Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) program* means an FAA-approved program for the routine collection and analysis of digital flight data gathered during aircraft operations, including data currently collected pursuant to existing regulatory provisions, when such data is included in an approved FOQA program.

\(2\) *FOQA data* means any digital flight data that has been collected from an individual aircraft pursuant to an FAA-approved FOQA program, regardless of the electronic format of that data.

\(3\) *Aggregate FOQA data* means the summary statistical indices that are associated with FOQA event categories, based on an analysis of FOQA data from multiple aircraft operations.

\(c\) *Requirements.* In order for paragraph (e) of this section to apply, the operator must submit, maintain, and adhere to a FOQA Implementation and Operation Plan that is approved by the Administrator and which contains the following elements:

\(1\) A description of the operator's plan for collecting and analyzing flight recorded data from line operations on a routine basis, including identification of the data to be collected;

\(2\) Procedures for taking corrective action that analysis of the data indicates is necessary in the interest of safety;

\(3\) Procedures for providing the FAA with aggregate FOQA data;

\(4\) Procedures for informing the FAA as to any corrective action being undertaken pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

\(d\) *Submission of aggregate data.* The operator will provide the FAA with aggregate FOQA data in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator.

\(e\) *Enforcement.* Except for criminal or deliberate acts, the Administrator will not use an operator's FOQA data or aggregate FOQA data in an enforcement action against that operator or its employees when such FOQA data or aggregate FOQA data is obtained from a FOQA program that is approved by the Administrator.

\(f\) *Disclosure.* FOQA data and aggregate FOQA data, if submitted in accordance with an order designating the information as protected under [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/K Administrative regulations/0193 Protection of voluntarily submitted information\|part 193 of this chapter]], will be afforded the nondisclosure protections of [[Notes/FAR/Volume 3/K Administrative regulations/0193 Protection of voluntarily submitted information\|part 193 of this chapter]].

\(g\) *Withdrawal of program approval.* The Administrator may withdraw approval of a previously approved FOQA program for failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter. Grounds for withdrawal of approval may include, but are not limited to—

\(1\) Failure to implement corrective action that analysis of available FOQA data indicates is necessary in the interest of safety; or

\(2\) Failure to correct a continuing pattern of violations following notice by the agency; or also

\(3\) Willful misconduct or willful violation of the FAA regulations in this chapter.

# Closer Look - The Standards (ACS)
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section provides an overview of the Airman Certification Standards (ACS), highlighting their importance in pilot training and preparation for the FAA practical test.

## Understanding the Airman Certification Standards (ACS):

1. The ACS integrates:
    1. Specific knowledge requirements.
    2. Skill performance metrics.
    3. Risk management elements for each task.
2. The ACS replaces the former Practical Test Standards (PTS).
3. Importance of the ACS:
    1. You will encounter these standards during the practical portion of your FAA test.
    2. Ensures all pilot candidates are tested to the same degree of proficiency.

## Applying the ACS in Training:

1. Use the ACS as a self-critiquing guide during solo practice.
2. Example performance standards:
    1. **Turns Around a Point:**
        1. Perform between 600 and 1,000 feet AGL (Above Ground Level).
    2. **Maneuvering During Slow Flight:**
        1. Perform at least 1,500 feet AGL.
        2. Maintain coordinated flight.
        3. Keep altitude within 100 feet.
        4. Maintain heading within 10 degrees.
        5. Keep airspeed no more than 10 knots above stall speed.
3. Demonstrate understanding of maneuvers:
    1. Explain aerodynamic factors and indicators.
    2. Identify various risk factors, including:
        1. Aircraft configuration.
        2. Collision avoidance.
4. This understanding is demonstrated during:
    1. The oral portion of the exam.
    2. The flight portion of the exam.

Remember, your FAA practical test is approaching. Practice to the same standards to which you will be tested to ensure your success.

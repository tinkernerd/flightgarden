# Sporty's E6B: Flight Planning and FAA Test Prep
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section provides an overview of the Sporty's Electronic E6B Flight Computer, covering its functions and how to use it for flight planning and FAA test preparation. It is aimed at new student pilots to assist them in understanding and utilizing this essential tool.

## Introduction to the E6B Flight Computer

1. Aviation calculations are essential for preflight preparation and cross-country planning.
2. Evolution of flight computers:
    1. Mechanical slide rule E6Bs were used by early pilots.
    2. Electronic E6Bs provided more intuitive operation and accurate results.
    3. Today, most pilots use flight planning software, but the E6B remains important.
3. The electronic E6B is considered required equipment by most pilots:
    1. Used during flight training for manual cross-country planning.
    2. Assists with FAA knowledge test preparation.
    3. Useful in-flight for calculations like winds aloft, true airspeed, fuel burn, and descent planning.

## Basic Operation of the Sporty's E6B

1. The Sporty's E6B controls are organized for quick access to functions.
2. Functions are grouped into six categories:
    1. Heading-Groundspeed and Pressure-Density Altitude
    2. Speed
    3. Required
    4. Wind
    5. Flight
    6. Weight and Balance
3. To use a function:
    1. Press its respective group button.
    2. Use the up/down arrows to highlight the desired function.
    3. Press Enter to activate the function.
4. Conversions and secondary functions:
    1. Conversions are listed in yellow text above gray arithmetic buttons.
    2. To convert units (e.g., Fahrenheit to Celsius):
        1. Enter the number (e.g., 50).
        2. Press CONV button.
        3. Press the button corresponding to the desired conversion.
    3. Secondary functions are accessed by pressing CONV and the relevant button (e.g., turning on backlighting).
5. Arithmetic operations can be performed at any time.

## Common Aviation Functions

## Pressure/Density Altitude Calculation

1. Select the Heading-Groundspeed and Pressure-Density Altitude group.
2. Use the down arrow to highlight the Pressure/Density Altitude function.
3. Press Enter to activate the function.
4. Enter Indicated Altitude (e.g., airport elevation).
5. Enter Barometric Pressure (altimeter setting in inches of mercury).
6. Enter Temperature in degrees Celsius.
7. The E6B displays Pressure Altitude and Density Altitude.

## Crosswind/Headwind Calculation

1. Select the Wind group.
2. Highlight the Crosswind/Headwind function and press Enter.
3. Enter Wind Direction.
4. Enter Wind Speed.
5. Enter Runway Number (between 1 and 36).
6. The E6B displays:
    1. Crosswind component (negative symbol indicates left crosswind).
    2. Headwind or Tailwind component (negative symbol indicates headwind).

## Heading/Groundspeed, Leg Time, and Required Fuel Calculations

1. Calculate Heading and Groundspeed:
    1. Select Heading-Groundspeed group and press Enter.
    2. Enter Winds Aloft Direction and Speed.
    3. Enter True Course.
    4. Enter True Airspeed.
    5. The E6B displays Groundspeed, True Heading, and Wind Correction Angle.
2. Calculate Leg Time:
    1. Select Flight group and choose the Leg Time function.
    2. Enter Leg Distance.
    3. The E6B uses the Groundspeed from the previous calculation.
    4. The E6B displays Leg Time.
3. Calculate Required Fuel:
    1. Select Required group and choose the Fuel Required function.
    2. The E6B uses the Leg Time from the previous calculation.
    3. Enter Fuel Burn Rate (e.g., gallons per hour).
    4. The E6B displays Fuel Required.

## Endurance Calculation

1. Select the Flight group and choose the Endurance function.
2. Enter Total Fuel Onboard (e.g., in gallons).
3. Enter Fuel Burn Rate (e.g., gallons per hour).
4. The E6B displays Endurance (available flight time).

## Actual True Airspeed Calculation

1. Select the Speed group and choose the Actual True Airspeed function.
2. Enter Pressure Altitude.
3. Enter Temperature in degrees Celsius.
4. Enter Calibrated Airspeed.
5. The E6B displays True Airspeed, Mach Number, and Density Altitude.

## Groundspeed Calculation

1. Select the Speed group and choose the Groundspeed function.
2. Enter Distance Traveled (in nautical miles).
3. Enter Time Taken (hours, minutes, seconds).
4. The E6B displays Groundspeed.

## Wind Speed and Direction Calculation

1. Select the Wind group and choose the Wind function.
2. Enter Course (Ground Track).
3. Enter True Airspeed.
4. Enter Groundspeed.
5. Enter Heading.
6. The E6B displays Wind Direction and Wind Speed.

## Distance Flown Calculation

1. Select the Flight group and choose the Distance Flown function.
2. Enter Groundspeed.
3. Enter Time (hours, minutes, seconds).
4. The E6B displays Distance Flown.

## Sporty's E6B Mobile App

1. Available for iPad, iPhone, and Android devices.
2. Includes the same functions and conversions as the handheld version.
3. Convenient when away from your flight bag or using a tablet in the cockpit.
4. Cannot be used on the FAA knowledge test.

Using the Sporty's Electronic E6B Flight Computer, you can efficiently perform essential aviation calculations for flight planning and in-flight navigation. Mastering its functions will aid you in your flight training and help you prepare for the FAA knowledge test.

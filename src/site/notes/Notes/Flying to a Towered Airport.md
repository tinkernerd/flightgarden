# Flying to a Towered Airport
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers the procedures and communication required when flying to and from a Class D tower-controlled airport, focusing on the use of ATIS, radio communications, and proper protocols for new student pilots.

## 1. Understanding ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service):

1. ATIS is a continuous broadcast of recorded non-control information including:
    1. Current weather conditions.
    2. NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen).
    3. Runways and approaches in use.
2. Purpose of ATIS:
    1. Provides essential but routine information to pilots.
    2. Reduces controller workload and frequency congestion.
3. Accessing ATIS:
    1. Available on a discrete VHF frequency or voice portion of a local NAVAID.
    2. Frequency can be found in the Chart Supplement or on aeronautical charts.
    3. Can be received up to 60 nautical miles from the airport and on the ground at the airport.
4. Content of ATIS Broadcasts:
    1. Latest METAR (weather report).
    2. Instrument approaches and runways in use.
    3. Information for arriving VFR aircraft, such as contact approach control frequency and distance.
    4. Note: Sky condition may be omitted if ceilings are above 5,000 feet; visibility may be omitted if more than 5 miles.
5. Updating ATIS Information:
    1. Updated typically at the top of each hour.
    2. Updates occur any time significant weather changes are observed.
    3. Each new recording is designated by a phonetic alphabet letter (e.g., Alpha, Bravo, Charlie).
6. Listening to ATIS:
    1. Listen to ATIS broadcast prior to arrival or departure.
    2. Note the phonetic identifier of the current ATIS.
    3. Advise the initial controller of the ATIS identifier upon contact.

## 2. Communicating with Air Traffic Control (ATC):

1. Initial Contact Procedures:
    1. Include "Student Pilot" at the end of your initial transmission to each new controller.
    2. This alerts controllers to provide extra assistance and patience.
2. Approaching a Class D Airspace:
    1. Contact the tower approximately 15 miles out.
    2. You must establish two-way radio communication before entering Class D airspace.
    3. The controller must acknowledge you with your call sign.
3. Example Radio Calls:
    1. Pilot: "Lunken Tower, Cessna one two zero six four, one four miles north, two thousand five hundred, landing, information Charlie."
    2. Tower: "Cessna one two zero six four, expect visual Runway two one left, say type aircraft."
    3. Pilot: "Zero six four is a Cessna Skyhawk."
    4. Tower: "Skyhawk zero six four, report four-mile final Runway two one left."
    5. Pilot: "Report four-mile final for two one left, Skyhawk zero six four."
4. Following ATC Instructions:
    1. Entry into the traffic pattern can be on any leg as instructed by ATC.
    2. Listen carefully and follow instructions for runway and approach paths.
    3. Use heading indicators (heading bug or HSI) to set assigned runway heading as a visual aid.

## 3. Landing Procedures:

1. Cleared to Land:
    1. Do not land until you receive a specific landing clearance from the tower.
    2. Read back the clearance to confirm.
2. Landing Options:
    1. If practicing landings, you may request "the option" which allows for:
        1. Touch-and-go.
        2. Stop-and-go.
        3. Full stop landing.
    2. Pilot: "Lunken tower, Skyhawk zero six four, request the option."
    3. Tower: "Skyhawk zero six four, cleared for the option Runway two five."
    4. Pilot: "Cleared for the option Runway two five, zero six four."
3. Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO):
    1. Used to increase airport capacity by allowing simultaneous operations on intersecting runways.
    2. Pilots must determine if their aircraft can safely land and stop within the available landing distance.
    3. Available Landing Distance (ALD) data is published in the Chart Supplement and U.S. Terminal Procedures Publications.
    4. If unsure or uncomfortable with LAHSO, especially as a student pilot, you should decline.
    5. Accepting a LAHSO clearance:
        1. Requires a full read back of the clearance.
        2. You must adhere to it unless amended by ATC or in an emergency.
    6. If unable to comply, initiate a go-around and advise ATC.
4. After Landing:
    1. Exit the runway promptly at the first available taxiway or as instructed by ATC.
    2. Do not stop or reverse course on the runway without ATC approval.
    3. Contact ground control when advised by the tower.
    4. Example ground communication:
        1. Pilot: "Lunken ground, Skyhawk one two zero six four, off two one left at Bravo, request taxi to the terminal."
        2. Ground: "Skyhawk zero six four, taxi straight ahead via Bravo, right on Charlie, cross Runway three left, hold short Runway seven two five."
        3. Pilot: "Straight on Bravo, right on Charlie, cross Runway three left, hold short Runway seven two five, zero six four."
5. Taxi Procedures:
    1. Always read back taxi instructions and any hold short clearances.
    2. Use airport diagrams to verify your taxi route.
    3. You must receive specific clearance to cross any runway.

## 4. Departure Procedures:

1. Before Taxiing:
    1. Obtain the current ATIS information.
    2. Note the expected runway and any pertinent NOTAMs.
2. Requesting Taxi Clearance:
    1. Contact ground control with your location, ATIS information, and departure request.
    2. Example call:
        1. Pilot: "Lunken ground, Skyhawk one two zero six four at the terminal ramp with information Delta, taxi for VFR departure east to Clermont County."
        2. Ground: "Skyhawk one two zero six four, Runway two one left, turn left on Alpha and taxi via Alpha, hold short Runway two one right."
        3. Pilot: "Left on Alpha to Runway two one left, hold short two one right, zero six four."
3. During Taxi:
    1. Set heading indicators to the assigned runway heading.
    2. Monitor ground frequency while performing before-takeoff checks.
    3. Obtain specific clearance to cross or operate on any runway along your route.
4. Ready for Takeoff:
    1. Contact tower when number one for takeoff at your assigned runway position.
    2. If departing from an intersection, advise the tower of your position.
    3. Example call:
        1. Pilot: "Lunken tower, Skyhawk one two zero six four, holding short Runway two five, ready for takeoff Runway two one left."
5. Takeoff Clearance:
    1. Receive and read back takeoff clearance, including any instructions.
    2. Example:
        1. Tower: "Skyhawk zero six four, fly runway heading, remain below Class Bravo, cleared for takeoff Runway two one left."
        2. Pilot: "Fly runway heading below the Bravo, cleared for takeoff Runway two one left, zero six four."
    3. When instructed to "fly runway heading," maintain the magnetic heading of the runway without drift correction.
6. After Takeoff:
    1. Follow any additional instructions from the tower.
    2. Example:
        1. Tower: "Skyhawk zero six four, turn on course to Clermont County."
        2. Pilot: "On course to Clermont, zero six four."
    3. Once clear of Class D airspace, you may change frequencies. Advising the tower of frequency change is courteous if frequency is not busy.

## 5. Additional Tips for Student Pilots:

1. Preparation:
    1. Review airport diagrams and familiarize yourself with taxiways and runways.
    2. Plan your communication and write down expected radio calls.
2. Situational Awareness:
    1. Listen carefully to ATC instructions and other traffic on the frequency.
    2. Maintain visual awareness of your surroundings.
3. Communication:
    1. Always read back clearances and instructions, especially hold short and runway crossing clearances.
    2. Don't hesitate to ask ATC for clarification if unsure.
4. Safety:
    1. Never assume; always verify ATC instructions.
    2. Remember that as Pilot in Command, you have the final authority for the safety of the flight.

By understanding and practicing proper communication and procedures, new student pilots can confidently operate in tower-controlled environments, enhancing both safety and efficiency in the airspace system.

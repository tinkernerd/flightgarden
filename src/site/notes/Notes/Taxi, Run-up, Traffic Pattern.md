# Taxi, Run-up, Traffic Pattern
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]


This section provides essential training notes for new student pilots on taxiing, performing run-up checks, and understanding airport traffic patterns.

## Taxiing Basics:

1. Understand that airplanes perform best in the air, but ground operations are essential.
    1. Your instructor may have you taxi during your first lesson.
2. Coordinate use of throttle, control yoke, and foot pedals.
    1. Steering is done with feet using rudder pedals linked to the nose wheel.
    2. Braking is achieved by pressing the top of the rudder pedals.
3. Steering and Braking Techniques:
    1. To turn right, push on the right pedal; to turn left, push on the left pedal.
    2. Use differential braking for sharper turns by applying the brake on the desired side.
    3. Avoid riding the brakes; keep heels on the floor and use toes for steering.
4. Power Management:
    1. Advance the throttle slowly to start moving, then reduce power once underway.
    2. Use brakes only to turn or stop; do not control speed with high power and brakes simultaneously.
    3. Maintain taxi speed no faster than a brisk walk.
5. Safety Precautions:
    1. Test brakes during the first few feet of taxiing to ensure proper function.
    2. In confined areas, taxi slowly enough that the airplane will stop if brakes fail and throttle is reduced.
6. Handling Wind During Taxi: [Crosswind Taxi Techniques - Pilot Institute](https://pilotinstitute.com/crosswind-taxi-techniques/)
    1. Strong winds can affect the airplane's balance; use proper control inputs.
        1. In a left quartering headwind: aileron left, elevator neutral.
        2. In a right quartering headwind: aileron right, elevator neutral.
        3. In a left quartering tailwind: aileron right, elevator down.
        4. In a right quartering tailwind: aileron left, elevator down.
    2. Remember: "Turn into a headwind, dive away from a tailwind."
    3. Practice these techniques even in light winds to build confidence.

## Run-Up Checks:

1. Positioning in the Run-Up Area:
    1. Park with adequate distance from other aircraft.
    2. Angle the airplane to direct propwash away from others.
2. Performing the Run-Up Checklist:
    1. Set parking brake.
    2. Ensure seats are secure and belts are snug.
    3. Verify doors and windows are closed and locked.
    4. Check flight controls for freedom and correct response.
    5. Set altimeter and align heading indicator with the compass.
    6. Set elevator trim tab to takeoff position.
    7. Confirm fuel gauges reflect correct fuel amount.
    8. Set mixture to rich; ensure fuel selector is on BOTH and fuel shut-off is ON.
    9. Engine Checks:
        1. Increase throttle to 1800 RPM.
        2. Check magnetos by turning each off individually; RPM drop should not exceed 150 RPM, with no more than 50 RPM difference between them.
        3. Verify vacuum gauge is in the green range.
        4. Check oil pressure and temperature are within operating range.
        5. Test alternator by turning on landing light and observing ammeter deflection.
        6. Ensure no warning lights are illuminated on the annunciator panel.
    10. Return throttle to idle (800-1000 RPM) and adjust friction lock as needed.
    11. Prepare for Takeoff:
        1. Turn on strobe and landing lights.
        2. Set avionics and GPS as required.
        3. Set transponder code to 1200 (VFR).
        4. Set flaps as needed (usually up for normal takeoff).

## Understanding Traffic Patterns:

1. Components of a Standard Left-Hand Traffic Pattern:
    1. Departure Leg: Direction flown during takeoff.
    2. Crosswind Leg: Flown at 90 degrees to the runway after takeoff.
    3. Downwind Leg: Parallel to the runway in the opposite direction of landing.
    4. Base Leg: Flown at 90 degrees to the runway before final approach.
    5. Final Approach Leg: Aligned with the runway heading into the wind.
2. Departing the Traffic Pattern:
    1. Climb straight ahead on the departure leg.
    2. Upon reaching pattern altitude, continue straight or turn 45 degrees in the pattern direction (left for standard patterns) to depart.
3. Entering the Traffic Pattern:
    1. Commonly done by approaching at a 45-degree angle to the midpoint of the downwind leg.
    2. Continue onto the downwind, base, and final legs for landing.
    3. Follow specific airport procedures as required.

## Runway Markings and Headings:

1. Understanding Runway Numbers:
    1. Runway numbers correspond to their magnetic direction rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, dropping the last zero.
        1. Example: Runway 36 is approximately 360 degrees (north).
        2. Runway 18 is approximately 180 degrees (south).
    2. Reciprocal runways have numbers 180 degrees apart.
    3. Parallel runways are identified with letters:
        1. L for Left
        2. C for Center
        3. R for Right
2. Compass Rose Directions:
    1. North: 360 degrees or 0 degrees
    2. Northeast: 45 degrees
    3. East: 90 degrees
    4. Southeast: 135 degrees
    5. South: 180 degrees
    6. Southwest: 225 degrees
    7. West: 270 degrees
    8. Northwest: 315 degrees
3. Alignment Confirmation:
    1. Runway heading should agree with the airplane's magnetic heading within 5 degrees.

Remember, mastering ground operations, run-up procedures, and understanding traffic patterns are essential steps towards becoming a proficient pilot. Practice these techniques to build confidence and ensure safety in all your flights.

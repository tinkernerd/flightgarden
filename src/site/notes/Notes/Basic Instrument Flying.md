# Basic Instrument Flying
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

These notes cover the essential aspects of basic instrument flying, emphasizing its importance for emergency situations and providing guidance on essential techniques for new student pilots.

## Introduction to Basic Instrument Flying:
1. Private Pilot applicants must demonstrate basic instrument flying skills for emergencies.
2. The training prepares pilots to handle unintentional encounters with instrument weather conditions.

## The Importance of Instrument Training:

1. Before the 1950s:
    1. Most general aviation airplanes lacked proper instrument flight equipment.
    2. Pilots relied on minimal instruments like a turn needle, ball, and possibly one radio.
2. By the 1950s:
    1. Advancements made it feasible to fully equip light airplanes for instrument flight.
3. Need for pilot training:
    1. Equipment alone is insufficient; pilots must be trained to fly by reference to instruments.
    2. Lack of training led to increased accidents in adverse weather conditions.
4. Regulatory changes:
    1. Certification rules now require demonstration of basic instrument flying skills.
    2. The goal is to enable pilots to return to visual conditions safely.

## Understanding Spatial Disorientation:

1. Common in weather-related accidents due to loss of visual reference.
2. Sensory systems for orientation:
    1. Vision.
    2. Motion sensing system of the inner ear.
    3. Position sensing system involving muscles, joints, and skin.
3. Challenges without visual cues:
    1. Misleading sensations can cause disorientation.
    2. Sudden head movements worsen sensations, especially during turns or pitching.
4. Solution:
    1. Proficient instrument pilots disregard misleading sensations.
    2. Trust and rely on instrument readings to control the airplane.

## Instrument Flying Fundamentals:

1. Flying by instruments mirrors flying with outside references; the airplane responds the same way.
2. The Attitude Indicator (Artificial Horizon):
    1. Replaces the natural horizon as the primary visual cue.
    2. Provides instantaneous, direct indications of pitch and bank attitudes.
    3. Other instruments offer indirect attitude information.
    4. Large aircraft have multiple attitude indicators due to their importance.
3. Methods of instrument flying:
    1. Control Performance Method:
        1. Emphasizes using the attitude indicator to establish and maintain attitudes.
        2. Other instruments check performance resulting from those attitudes.
    2. Primary and Supporting Method:
        1. Designates instruments as primary or supporting based on the information provided.
        2. Primary instruments give the most pertinent information; supporting instruments confirm it.

## Developing Instrument Skills:

1. Three key skills:
    1. Scanning the instruments.
    2. Interpreting instrument indications.
    3. Aircraft control based on instrument readings.
2. Effective scanning:
    1. A continuous and logical observation pattern.
    2. Avoid common errors:
        1. Fixation on a single instrument.
        2. Omitting instruments from the scan.
        3. Overemphasis on one instrument.
    3. Proficient pilots spend most of their time on the attitude indicator, periodically checking other instruments.

## Airplane Control Components:

1. Consist of power, pitch, and bank.
2. Instrument flight uses the same control inputs as visual flight.
    1. Attitude indicator is key for establishing and maintaining desired attitudes.
    2. Trim is essential to relieve control pressures and reduce pilot workload.

## Basic Instrument Maneuvers:

1. Straight and level flight:
    1. Use the attitude indicator to maintain pitch and bank.
    2. Confirm with altimeter (pitch) and heading indicator (bank).
    3. Make small adjustments to correct deviations.
2. Constant airspeed climbs and descents:
    1. Adjust pitch and power to achieve desired airspeed and rate.
    2. Use the attitude indicator for initial settings; verify with airspeed indicator and vertical speed indicator.
    3. Begin level-offs 10% of the climb or descent rate before reaching the desired altitude.
3. Turns to headings:
    1. Use coordinated aileron and rudder to establish the desired bank angle.
    2. Limit turns to standard rate (3 degrees per second) or half-standard rate for small heading changes.
    3. Start roll-out before reaching the target heading (lead by half the bank angle in degrees).
4. Recovery from unusual attitudes:
    1. Recognize unusual attitudes using the attitude indicator and supporting instruments.
    2. Nose-high recovery:
        1. Add power to prevent altitude loss.
        2. Lower the nose to level flight attitude.
        3. Level the wings.
    3. Nose-low recovery:
        1. Reduce power to prevent excessive airspeed.
        2. Level the wings.
        3. Raise the nose to level flight attitude.
    4. Avoid overcontrolling to prevent entering opposite unusual attitudes.

## Additional Considerations:

1. Simulated instrument flight training:
    1. Conducted under VFR conditions using a visor or hood.
    2. An instructor or safety pilot is required to watch for other aircraft.
2. Using radio communications and navigation aids:
    1. Increases pilot workload.
    2. Always prioritize flying the airplane.
    3. Maintain wings level and trust your instruments.
3. Limitations of basic instrument training:
    1. Designed for emergency situations only.
    2. Does not prepare pilots for intentional flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).

Remember, basic instrument flying skills are essential for managing unexpected situations. Trust your instruments, maintain a disciplined scan, and always prioritize aircraft control to ensure safe flight.

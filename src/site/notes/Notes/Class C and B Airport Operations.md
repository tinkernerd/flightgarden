# Class C and B Airport Operations
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers the procedures and communication techniques for operating in Class C and Class B airspace, focusing on transitioning from smaller airports to busier airspaces, and ensuring safe and efficient operations for new student pilots.

## Class C Airspace Operations

1. Transitioning from Class D to Class C airspace:
    1. Not significantly more difficult once familiar with Class D operations.
    2. Expect tower, ground, and clearance delivery controllers, and an ATIS broadcast.
    3. Class C adds approach and departure controllers to guide you.
2. Busier airspace and radio communications:
    1. Flow is logical and aligned with the Aeronautical Information Manual.
    2. Fewer non-standard surprises compared to smaller airports.
    3. Ground operations may be more complex; request progressive taxi if needed.
3. Class C airspace structure:
    1. Outer ring typically extends 10 nautical miles from the airport center.
    2. An uncharted outer area may extend up to 20 nautical miles.
    3. Contact approach control within the outer area, before reaching the charted outer ring.

## Entering Class C Airspace

1. Prior to entry:
    1. Listen to the ATIS broadcast for current airport information.
    2. Find the appropriate approach control frequency on the sectional chart or Airport/Facility Directory (AFD).
2. Initial contact with approach control:
    1. Advise the controller you have the current ATIS information and state your intentions.
    2. Await acknowledgment and radar identification before entering the airspace.
    3. Establishing radio contact allows entry into Class C airspace.
    4. If the controller does not acknowledge your call sign, radio contact is not established, and you must not enter.

## Maintaining Visual Separation

1. When instructed to "maintain visual separation":
    1. You are responsible for keeping visual contact with the specified aircraft.
    2. Maneuver as needed to avoid the other aircraft safely.
    3. No minimum distance specified; use judgment to maintain safe separation.
    4. If you lose visual contact, immediately inform the controller.
    5. If unable to accept visual separation, advise the controller promptly.

## Approach to Tower Handoff

1. As you approach the airport:
    1. Approach control will hand you off to the tower controller.
    2. The tower frequency may not be provided; be prepared by finding it beforehand.
    3. Set the tower frequency as a standby to facilitate smooth communication.
    4. If unsure, ask the controller for the frequency.
2. Communication with tower:
    1. Proceed as you would when flying into Class D airspace.
    2. Follow tower instructions for landing clearance and taxi procedures.

## Departing from Class C Airspace

1. Pre-departure procedures:
    1. Listen to the ATIS broadcast; at busy airports, do this before engine start.
    2. Be aware of possible engine starting delays communicated via ATIS.
2. First contact with ATC:
    1. Contact clearance delivery before taxiing for VFR clearance and transponder code.
    2. Write down instructions and read them back to the controller.
3. Taxi procedures:
    1. Taxi to the edge of the non-movement area before contacting ground control.
    2. Request taxi clearance from ground control.
    3. Monitor ground frequency while completing before-takeoff checks.
4. Takeoff and departure:
    1. Contact tower when ready for departure.
    2. After takeoff, tower will hand you off to departure control.
    3. Switch to the assigned frequency from your clearance.
5. Leaving controlled airspace:
    1. Departure may provide radar vectors or allow you to resume own navigation.
    2. Remember, "resume own navigation" does not release you from ATC communication.
    3. Only change frequencies when specifically released by the controller.

## Class B Airspace Operations

1. Understanding Class B airspace:
    1. Found around the busiest airports in the U.S.
    2. Operations are similar to Class C but with regulatory differences.
    3. Airspace and radio communications may be busier.
2. Class B airspace structure:
    1. The shape is unique to each area, designed based on specific needs.
    2. Initial contact with controllers should be made well outside the depicted airspace.
    3. Contact ATC 5 to 10 miles before reaching Class B airspace boundary.
3. Entering Class B airspace:
    1. Explicit permission is required to enter Class B airspace.
    2. Simply establishing radio contact is not sufficient, unlike in Class C and D airspace.
    3. Ensure you receive a clear clearance to enter before proceeding.

Remember, thorough preparation and clear communication with air traffic control are essential when operating in Class C and Class B airspace. Stay ahead by planning your frequencies, understanding procedures, and always confirming permissions to ensure safe and efficient flights.

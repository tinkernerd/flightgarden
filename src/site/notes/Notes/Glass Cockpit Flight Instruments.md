# Glass Cockpit Flight Instruments
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers the features, similarities, and differences of glass cockpit flight instruments, specifically focusing on the Garmin G1000 system, to help new student pilots understand how to interpret and use these modern flight displays.

## Attitude Indicator:

1. Prominent and easy to interpret on the PFD.
2. Unique features not found on analog gauges:
    1. Red warning chevrons appear at extreme pitch angles (above +50° and below -30°) pointing toward the horizon to aid reorientation.
    2. PFD declutters at excessive pitch or bank angles (over +30°/-20° pitch or over 65° bank) to focus on the attitude indicator.
3. The background moves (earth, horizon, sky) while the yellow airplane symbol remains stationary.

## Slip/Skid Indicator:

1. Located under the triangle roll pointer; appears as a small horizontal line.
2. Functions like a standard inclinometer: "step on the line" to correct slip or skid.

## Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI):

1. Displays a rotating compass card with cardinal points, numeric labels, and tick marks.
2. Can be viewed as a full unit or as an arc using softkeys.
3. Features include:
    1. Large heading box at the top for direct digital readout of heading.
    2. Rotatable heading bug on the compass rose for desired heading selection.
    3. Selected heading and course boxes on either side of the lubber line:
        1. Selected heading box (light blue numerals) on the left.
        2. Selected course box (magenta for GPS, green for VOR/LOC) on the right.
    4. Current track indicator (magenta diamond) shows the aircraft's track over the ground; useful in crosswinds.
    5. Bearing pointers can be overlaid to display bearings to additional nav sources.
    6. Magenta trend vector displays current turn rate and indicates heading six seconds ahead.
    7. Turn rate indicator with tick marks at 9° and 18° for half-standard and standard rate turns.

## Airspeed Indicator:

1. Vertical tape display with familiar color coding (white, green, yellow, red).
2. Actual airspeed displayed inside a black pointer.
3. Additional features:
    1. Magenta airspeed trend vector indicates airspeed six seconds ahead if current rate continues.
    2. V-speed reference marks adjacent to their respective speeds; adjustable as needed.
    3. Barber pole pattern appears when exceeding VNE; black airspeed pointer turns red.
    4. Red range mark appears as a warning when approaching stall speeds.
    5. True airspeed (TAS) displayed below the tape.

## Altimeter:

1. Vertical tape display; easier to read than traditional analog altimeters.
2. Features include:
    1. Barometric pressure setting box under the tape; set using baro knobs.
    2. Selected altitude box and bug for altitude reminders; set using the ALT knob.
    3. Altitude trend vector indicates altitude six seconds ahead at current rate of climb or descent.

## Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI):

1. Non-moving vertical tape attached to the altimeter.
2. Displays vertical speed via a pointer with numerical indication starting beyond ±100 ft/min.
3. Magenta chevron indicates required vertical speed when nearing top of descent.

## Navigation and Communication Frequencies:

1. Located at the top left and right of both PFD and MFD screens.
2. Active frequencies are innermost; standby frequencies are outermost.
3. Features include:
    1. Active COM frequency turns green when selected on the audio panel.
    2. NAV frequency auto-identifies and turns green when the facility is in range.
    3. Tuning box can be switched between NAV1/NAV2 and COM1/COM2 by pushing the inner knobs.
    4. Frequencies can be dialed manually or selected from waypoint and nearest pages.

## Navigation Status Bar:

1. Located between the frequency windows.
2. Provides current flight information:
    1. Next waypoint and distance.
    2. Desired and current track.
    3. Messages and alerts area.

## Transponder Status Bar:

1. Located in the lower right corner of the PFD.
2. Displays "GND" when on the ground; changes to "ALT" after takeoff based on airspeed.
3. Operated using appropriate softkeys; provides transponder functionality.

## Inset Information Boxes:

1. Can display various information on the PFD:
    1. Alerts and messages.
    2. Nearest airports.
    3. Timer functions.
    4. V-speed changes.
    5. Flight plan details.
    6. DME tuning.
2. Activated using the PFD softkeys.

## Map Inset Box:

1. Displays GPS position and flight information.
2. Located on the lower left side of the PFD.
3. Provides an abbreviated moving map from the MFD.

## Outside Air Temperature:

1. Displayed in the extreme left corner of the PFD.
2. Provides current outside air temperature information.

## Audio Panel and Marker Beacon Controls:

1. Located between the PFD and MFD screens.
2. Comprises communication, navigation, and intercom systems.
3. Features include:
    1. Digital recorder plays back the last 2.5 minutes of communication audio.
    2. Recording is automatic when a COM signal is received.
    3. Emergency frequency (121.5 MHz) auto-tuned if communication system fails.
    4. Fail-safe circuit connects pilot's headset directly to COM1 if the audio panel fails.
    5. Audio inputs for music or device audio via 3.5 mm jacks.
    6. SiriusXM radio entertainment is optional.

## Alerts and Annunciations:

1. The G1000 alerting system informs the pilot of vital information.
2. Methods of alerting:
    1. Annunciation window on the right side of the PFD displays alerts.
    2. Alerts window can be activated using the alerts softkey.
    3. Audible tones or voice alerts accompany certain warnings.
3. Alert levels:
    1. **Warning (Red):** Immediate attention required; continuous audible tone.
    2. **Caution (Yellow):** May require pilot intervention; single audible tone.
    3. **Advisory (White):** General information; no audible alert.
4. Major system failures indicated by a large red "X" on the affected display.

## Additional Notes:

1. **Reversionary Mode:** Activated by pressing the display backup button on the audio panel.
2. **Stuck Microphone Detection:**
    1. Transmitter stops after 35 seconds of continuous transmission.
    2. An alert appears on the PFD indicating a stuck microphone.
    3. COM MIC key annunciator flashes to indicate the issue.
3. Refer to the aircraft information manual for detailed information on alerts and annunciations.

Understanding these features of the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit will enhance your situational awareness and make flying safer and more efficient.

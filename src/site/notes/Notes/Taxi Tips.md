This section provides essential tips for safely and efficiently taxiing an aircraft from the parking spot to the runway, emphasizing awareness, proper handling, and preparation for flight.

## Awareness of Surroundings:

1. Be conscious of your environment when the propeller is turning:
    1. Avoid prolonged engine running on crowded ramps or near buildings.
    2. After starting, gently maneuver away from people and structures.
2. Keep hands on the controls at all times:
    1. Right hand on the throttle.
    2. Left hand on the yoke or stick, ready for unexpected situations.
3. Avoid distractions while taxiing:
    1. Do not program GPS or devices while the aircraft is moving.
    2. Maintain focus on your surroundings and potential hazards.
4. Monitor nearby surroundings:
    1. Watch for buildings, fences, or other aircraft when maneuvering.
    2. Be vigilant when approaching intersections and runways.

## Proper Taxi Techniques:

1. Avoid riding the brakes:
    1. Do not taxi with power while simultaneously applying brakes.
    2. Use gentle power applications to start moving.
    3. Once in motion, minimal power is needed to continue forward.
2. Check flight instruments during taxi:
    1. Ensure the turn coordinator and heading indicator respond correctly.
    2. Verify all instruments are functioning properly before takeoff.
3. Crossing runways and taxiways:
    1. Always look both ways to confirm no traffic is approaching.
    2. At tower-controlled airports, double-check clearances visually.

## Preparation for Takeoff:

1. At the run-up area:
    1. Set the parking brake for added security.
    2. Monitor aircraft position during engine run-up to prevent movement.
2. Mental preparation:
    1. Anticipate potential issues during takeoff and flight.
    2. Consider your immediate reactions to possible problems.
    3. Discuss objectives with your instructor and rehearse them mentally.

These taxi tips are valuable for pilots of all experience levels and aircraft types, promoting safety and efficiency throughout your flying years.

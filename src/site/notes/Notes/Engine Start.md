# Engine Start
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers the standard procedures for safely starting the engine of a Cessna 172, emphasizing both safety and following checklists for reliable operations.

## Pre-Start Safety:

1. Ensure the tail of the airplane is not pointed at:
    1. People.
    2. Other aircraft.
    3. Objects that might be damaged by propeller wind blast.
2. This is important for:
    1. Courtesy.
    2. Safety.

## Before Start Checklist:

1. Set the parking brake.
2. Be ready to use foot pedal brakes in case the parking brake doesn't hold.
3. Adjust seats and seat belts; ensure they are buckled.
4. Once certified, brief your passengers.
5. Set the fuel selector valve to "BOTH".
6. Push the fuel shutoff valve all the way in (ON position).
7. Check that circuit breakers are in.
8. Ensure the avionics master switch is OFF.
    - Engine start subjects the electrical system to unusual currents.
    - You want all available power for starting the engine.
9. Look outside for people or obstacles near the airplane.
    - Your attention was focused inside the cockpit.
10. Open the throttle about a quarter of an inch.
    - Allows fuel to enter the engine.
    - Keeps engine at low speed when it starts, reducing wear.
11. Confirm the mixture control is in the "idle / cut-off" position.
12. Turn on the beacon switch.
    - Beacon warns others you're about to start the engine when master switch is turned on.
    - Some pilots leave the beacon switch on all the time to prevent leaving the master switch on after flight.

## Engine Start Procedure:

1. Turn on the master switch.
2. Open a window and call "Clear" to alert anyone nearby.
3. Give people time to react and ensure the propeller area is clear.
4. Activate the electric fuel pump (auxiliary fuel pump).
5. Prime the injector nozzle lines:
    - Advance the mixture control until fuel flow shows 3 to 5 gallons per hour.
    - Pull the mixture back to the "idle / cut-off" position.
6. Turn off the auxiliary fuel pump.
7. Turn the key to start; release it when the engine starts.
8. Advance the mixture control smoothly to "full rich".
9. Check for proper oil pressure:
    1. Oil pressure should appear within a few seconds.
    2. In very cold weather, it may take longer.
    3. If oil pressure is not in the green arc within 30 seconds, shut off the engine and consult a mechanic.

## Post-Start Actions:

- Once the engine is running:
	1. Turn on the avionics master switch.
	2. Raise the flaps.
	3. Activate any additional necessary lighting.

## Additional Notes:

1. This procedure is for a normal cold start of a Cessna 172.
2. Variations for warm or flooded engines are detailed in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).
3. Other aircraft models may have different procedures.
4. Always follow the checklist for your specific airplane and situation.

Remember, adhering to proper engine start procedures ensures safety, extends the life of your aircraft, and sets a foundation for responsible flying.

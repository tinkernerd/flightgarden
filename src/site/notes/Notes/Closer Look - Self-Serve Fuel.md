# Closer Look - Self-Serve Fuel
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section provides an overview of using self-serve fuel at airports, guiding new student pilots through the process of safely and efficiently fueling their aircraft, which can offer significant cost savings and convenience.

## Benefits of Self-Serve Fuel:

1. Cost savings due to a cheaper price per gallon.
2. Availability after hours when the FBO is closed.
3. Flexibility as an alternative fueling option.

## Locating the Fuel Pump:

1. Identify the location of the self-serve fuel pump at the airport:
    1. Contact UNICOM for directions if unfamiliar with the airport.
    2. If arriving after hours, call the FBO ahead of time for information.
    3. Plan ahead to taxi directly to the pump without unnecessary shutdowns.

## Parking at the Fuel Pump:

1. Park close to the pump but maintain a safe distance:
    1. Most pumps have long hoses to reach both wing tanks.
    2. If uncomfortable taxiing close to obstacles, shut down and use a towbar to reposition the aircraft.

## Preparing the Aircraft for Fueling:

1. After shutdown:
    1. Remove keys from the ignition.
    2. Verify the master switch is off.
    3. Prevent accidental sparks or engine starts.
2. Utilize available equipment:
    1. Use provided chocks to secure the airplane.
    2. Use gloves and a ladder if available.

## Grounding the Aircraft:

1. Attach the grounding wire from the pump to the aircraft:
    1. Typically connect to the exhaust pipe.
    2. Prevents static discharge during fueling.

## Operating the Fuel Pump:

1. Swipe your credit card:
    1. Enter the number of gallons or dollars and select the fuel type.
    2. Have an estimated amount in mind, even if topping off.
2. Select the correct hose:
    1. Usually two hoses: one for Jet-A, one for 100LL.
    2. Nozzles should be different, but always double-check.
3. Activate the pump with the switch or lever before fuel will flow.

## Fueling the Aircraft:

1. Pull out more hose than initially needed to provide slack:
    1. Makes it easier when fueling high-wing airplanes.
2. Remove the fuel cap and keep it in a known location.
3. Fuel the aircraft carefully:
    1. Aircraft pumps do not have automatic shut-off valves.
    2. Avoid overfilling and spills to prevent messes and clothing stains.
4. Immediately replace the fuel cap after fueling each tank.

## After Fueling:

1. Turn off the pump with the switch or lever.
2. Retract the fuel hose:
    1. Use the retract button to wind the hose back into its reel.
    2. Keep the hose under control as it may retract quickly.
3. Remove the grounding wire and retract it:
    1. Use automatic retraction if available.
4. Clean up the area and return equipment to its proper place.
5. Perform a final walk-around:
    1. Verify fuel caps are secure.
    2. Ensure the aircraft is ready for flight.

## Conclusion:

1. Self-serve fuel can save money and is convenient when the FBO is closed.
2. Check fuel prices and availability during preflight planning:
    1. The "full" price is what the FBO charges to fuel you from the truck.
3. With experience, the self-serve fueling process becomes easy and worthwhile.

After your first self-serve fueling experience, you'll find the process to be quite easy and well worth the effort.

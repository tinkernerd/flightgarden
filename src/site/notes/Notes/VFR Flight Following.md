# VFR Flight Following
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section introduces VFR flight following, an optional service that provides VFR pilots with additional situational awareness and assistance from air traffic control (ATC).

## What is Flight Following?
1. Flight following is an optional service provided by ATC to VFR aircraft in Class E airspace on a workload-permitting basis.
2. The service involves radar identification and communication between the VFR aircraft and a controller.
3. Benefits of flight following:
    1. ATC provides traffic advisories and other assistance.
    2. Enhances safety by having an extra set of eyes on your flight.

## How to Request Flight Following
1. Contact an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) or Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility.
    1. ARTCC or "center" frequencies can be found in the Chart Supplement.
    2. TRACON or "approach" frequencies are listed on sectional charts and in the Chart Supplement.

## During Flight Following
1. Communication:
    1. Maintain two-way communication with ATC.
    2. Advise the controller if you need to leave the frequency temporarily (e.g., to update weather).
2. Monitoring Frequencies:
    1. You may listen to weather broadcasts like ASOS or HIWAS without leaving the ATC frequency.
        1. Select the audio output for the second radio on your audio panel while maintaining ATC communication.
        2. Listen carefully to both, giving priority to ATC transmissions.
3. Navigation and Responsibility:
    1. Primary navigation remains the pilot's responsibility.
    2. Continue to exercise "see and avoid" practices.

## Handoffs and Termination
1. ATC may coordinate handoffs to the next sector and provide a new frequency.
    1. At times, due to controller workload, a direct handoff may not be possible.
2. Terminating Flight Following:
    2. As a VFR pilot, you may cancel flight following at any time.
    3. Inform ATC of your intention to terminate the service.

## Benefits to ATC
1. Flight following helps ATC by:
    1. Confirming the aircraft's identity, route, and altitude.
    2. Allowing improved traffic management, especially with IFR traffic.

Remember, utilizing flight following enhances safety by providing additional support from ATC while you maintain responsibility for your flight's navigation and visual separation from other aircraft.

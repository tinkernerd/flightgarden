# Engine Suspicion
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]


This section emphasizes the importance of careful engine operation, starting from basic trainers to advanced turbocharged airplanes. It highlights the significance of being vigilant about engine performance to maintain safety in flight.

## Engine Care and Operation:

1. Operate engines with care from the early days of training:
    1. Laying a good foundation with four-cylinder engines prepares for advanced engines.
    2. Advanced turbocharged engines require more care to prevent issues like detonation or pre-ignition.
2. Run the mixture slightly rich if in doubt:
    1. Err on the side of using too much fuel rather than too little.
    2. A richer mixture helps cool the engine by allowing unburned fuel to absorb heat.
    3. Not a mandate to run extremely rich, but to err on the side of caution.
3. Utilize advanced engine instrumentation:
    1. Provides exhaust gas temperature (EGT) readings for each cylinder.
    2. Alerts when reaching peak EGT, aiding in proper mixture management.

## Being Vigilant About Engine Performance:

1. Always be suspicious of unusual engine behavior:
    1. If something doesn't seem right before takeoff, taxi back and have a mechanic check it.
    2. If in flight and something seems off, land as soon as it's safe and practical.
2. Heed warning signs promptly:
    1. Do not ignore initial indications of trouble, such as rough running or abnormal indications.
    2. Addressing issues early can prevent serious problems or accidents.
3. Learn from historical evidence:
    1. Many engine failure accidents had prior warning signs that were ignored.
    2. Taking care of the airplane and engine ensures they will take care of you.

Remember, attentive engine operation and prompt action at any sign of trouble are crucial for safe flying. Building good habits early ensures readiness for more advanced flying and helps maintain safety in all flight operations.

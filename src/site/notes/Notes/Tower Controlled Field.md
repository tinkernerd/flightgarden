# Tower Controlled Field
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]


This section provides an overview of the procedures required to depart from an airport with an air traffic control tower, aimed at new student pilots learning to navigate tower-controlled fields effectively and safely.

## Pre-Taxi Procedures

1. Listen to the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS):
    1. Obtain the current weather information and active runway.
    2. Note the information code letter (e.g., "Information Delta").
2. Prepare to call ground control:
    1. Remember the "Four Ws":
        1. Who you are calling (e.g., "Lunken Ground").
        2. Who you are (e.g., "Cessna 12064").
        3. Where you are on the airport (e.g., "at Hangar 12").
        4. What you want to do (e.g., "VFR Northbound with Information Delta").
    2. Make the radio call to ground control:
    
    - "Lunken Ground, Cessna 12064 at Hangar 12, VFR Northbound with Information Delta."
    
3. Receive and read back taxi instructions:
    1. Ground control will provide taxi route and instructions:
    
    - "12064 Lunken Ground, Runway 21R, taxi via Charlie Alpha. Cross Runway 25 and hold short Runway 21R."
    
    2. Read back the instructions clearly:
    
    - "Taxi 21R via Charlie and Alpha. Cross Runway 25 and hold short 21R, Cessna 12064."
    

## Taxiing Procedures

1. Understand your taxi route and clearance limit:
    1. Ensure you know the exact path to your assigned runway.
    2. Identify the taxiways and runways on the airport diagram.
2. Focus on taxiing duties:
    1. Prioritize safe and accurate taxiing.
    2. Defer any aircraft checks, GPS programming, or other tasks until parked in the run-up area.
3. Stay tuned to ground control frequency:
    1. Monitor for any changes or further instructions from ATC.

## Operating at Tower-Controlled Fields

1. Expect busier traffic compared to non-towered fields:
    1. Stay vigilant for other aircraft movements.
    2. Be considerate and maintain situational awareness.
2. Use designated run-up areas:
    1. Complete before-takeoff checks without blocking taxiways.
    2. Ensure all checklists are completed thoroughly.

## Before Takeoff

1. Taxi up to the hold-short line:
    1. Get in line for departure if other aircraft are waiting.
2. Contact the tower when ready:
    1. Again, use the "Four Ws":
        1. Who you are calling (e.g., "Lunken Tower").
        2. Who you are (e.g., "Cessna 12064").
        3. Where you are (e.g., "holding short of Runway 21R").
        4. What you want (e.g., "ready for departure").
    2. Make the radio call:
    
    - "Lunken Tower, Cessna 12064 holding short of Runway 21R, ready for departure."
    
3. Follow tower's instructions:
    1. Tower may instruct you to hold short or proceed:
    
    - "12064 Lunken Tower, hold short Runway 21R, traffic crossing the runway."
    - "Hold short Runway 21R, Cessna 12064."
    
    2. When cleared, read back and comply:
    
    - "Cessna 12064, turn right on course, Runway 21R cleared for takeoff."
    - "Cleared for takeoff Runway 21R, right on course, Cessna 12064."
    

## Following Tower Instructions

1. After takeoff clearance:
    1. Execute the departure as instructed by the tower.
    2. Maintain awareness of other aircraft and comply with any further instructions.

With preparation and understanding of procedures, departing from tower-controlled fields becomes straightforward. Stay attentive, communicate clearly, and you'll soon be comfortable operating in controlled airspace.

# Touch and Go
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers the practice of touch and go's in flight training, their purpose, procedures, and considerations for student pilots.

## What is a Touch and Go?

1. Definition:
    1. A landing where, while still rolling, you reconfigure the airplane for takeoff and go right back up.
2. Purpose:
    2. Practice takeoffs and landings without the added time to taxi back to the departure end after landing.
3. Considerations:
    1. Should not be taken lightly due to various items to adjust while maintaining control:
        1. Flaps
        2. Trim

## What is a Stop and Go?

1. Definition:
    1. The airplane is brought to a full stop on the runway before taking off again.
2. Considerations:
    2. Ties up the runway longer; must ensure adequate distance remains for takeoff.

## Communication Procedures

1. At Tower-Controlled Fields:
    1. Request the "option" to perform a touch and go or stop and go.
        1. Example: "Lunken tower, Cessna Three Five Sierra, requests the option, runway two one left."
2. At Non-Towered Fields:
    2. Announce your intentions.
        1. Example: "Clermont County traffic, Cessna Three Five Sierra is left downwind, runway 4, touch and go, Clermont County."

## Common Practice

1. At airports with lots of training, touch and go's are very common.

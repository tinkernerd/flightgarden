[[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \| All Class Notes]]
This section introduces the fundamental of aviation communications, covering standard radio procedures, proper phraseology, and communication techniques essential from student pilots.
## Overview of Aviation Communications
1. English is the international language of aviations. 
2. Aviation uses specific words and phrases that may be confusing at first. 
3. Understanding radio communications improves with familiarity and practice
4. Using the radio is similar to using a telephone, but only one person can talk at a time. 

## Proper Radio Communication Procedures
1. Remember the Four W's of radio communication: 
	1. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> Who you are calling.</mark>
	2. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Who you are.</mark>
	3. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> Where you are.</mark>
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">What you want. </mark>
2. Be clear and concise; eliminate unnecessary words.
3. Use the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) as the official source for procedures.
4. Familiarize yourself with the Pilot-Controller Glossary.
5. Example of an initial radio call:
    1. "<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Butler County UNICOM</mark>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cessna One Two One Uniform Charlie</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ten miles north, three thousand feet, inbound for landing</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">request airport advisory</mark>."

## Pronunciation Guidelines

1. Altitudes and Heights:
    1. Express in thousands and hundreds: "Niner thousand fife hundred" for 9,500 feet.
    2. Above 10,000 feet, pronounce individual digits: "One two thousand fife hundred" for 12,500 feet.
    3. Above 18,000 feet, use flight levels: "Flight Level Two Tree Zero" for 23,000 feet.
2. Frequencies:
    1. State each digit, say "point" for decimal: "One two two point one".
3. Headings and Bearings:
    1. Express as three-digit numbers: "Heading zero one zero".
    2. Assumed to be magnetic unless "true" is specified.
4. Speeds:
    1. Pronounced as individual digits: "One two zero knots".
    2. The word "knots" may be included for clarity.
5. Time:
    1. Use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local time.
    2. State the time in four digits: "Zero niner two zero" for 0920 Zulu.

## Radio Communication Techniques and Best Practices

1. Position the microphone close to your lips; speak in a normal, clear voice.
2. Use a headset to improve clarity and reduce cockpit noise.
3. Understand the meaning of common phrases:
    1. "Roger" means the message was received (not yes or no).
    2. "Affirmative" means yes; "Negative" means no.
    3. "Wilco" means will comply with the instruction.
4. If you make a mistake, correct yourself and continue.
5. Practice proper radio etiquette and be patient.
6. Responding to ATC instructions:
    1. ATC: "Aztec Two Sierra Papa, left heading Two Tree Zero."
    2. Pilot: "Heading Two Tree Zero, Aztec Two Sierra Papa."

## Using UNICOM and CTAF Frequencies

1. UNICOM is a non-government radio station at airports without control towers.
2. Use the airport name followed by "UNICOM" when calling: "Clermont UNICOM".
3. CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency) is used for traffic advisories at non-towered airports.
4. Make position reports and communicate intentions on CTAF.
5. Be aware that UNICOM may not always be attended.

Remember, effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in aviation. Practice regularly to build confidence and proficiency in your radio communication skills.

This section covers the understanding of the airspace system in the United States, including the classifications, requirements, and rules for different classes of airspace.

## Overview of Airspace Classification

1. Airspace designation is driven by the activities that occur within it.
2. The purpose of different airspace rules is safety.
3. The level of control in an area depends on:
    1. The density of aircraft.
    2. The types of operations.
    3. The level of safety required.
    4. The national and public interest.
4. Airspace is divided into:
    1. Controlled Airspace (Classes A, B, C, D, and E).
    2. Uncontrolled Airspace (Class G).
    3. Special Use Airspace.
    4. Other Airspace Areas.
5. Controlled Airspace is generally where Air Traffic Control (ATC) services are provided.
6. The United States airspace follows the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) classification system:
    1. Class A: High-altitude operations.
    2. Class B: Busy airport areas.
    3. Class C: Moderate traffic airports.
    4. Class D: Smaller towered airports.
    5. Class E: Controlled airspace not designated as A, B, C, or D.
    6. Class G: Uncontrolled airspace.
7. Note: There is no Class F airspace in the United States.

## Class D Airspace

1. Surrounds tower-controlled airports not associated with Class B or C airspace.
2. Requirements to operate in Class D airspace:
    1. Establish two-way radio communication with ATC before entering.
    2. No explicit clearance required.
    3. Hold at least a Student Pilot Certificate.
3. Depicted on VFR charts with segmented blue lines.
4. Vertical boundaries are charted inside a segmented box in hundreds of feet MSL.
5. Class D airspace may revert to Class E or G when the tower is not in operation.

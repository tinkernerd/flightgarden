# Air Facts - When Enough's Not Enough
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section emphasizes the importance of adding safety margins to performance calculations to ensure safe flying practices beyond the minimal legal requirements.

## Understanding Performance Numbers:
1. Performance figures in manuals are based on new airplanes flown by test pilots in ideal conditions.
2. These numbers have no built-in safety margins.
3. Replicating these numbers in real-world conditions is challenging.
## Adding Margins to Performance Calculations:
1. Regulations and Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) do not provide guidelines on safety margins.
2. Adopt modified airline rules to establish personal minimums:
	1. **Takeoff Margins:**
		1. Ensure runway length allows acceleration to liftoff speed and then a full stop if necessary.
		2. Double the takeoff run distance from the POH for minimum allowable runway length.
		3. Double the distance required to clear a 50-foot obstacle for obstruction clearance.
	2. **Landing Margins:**
		1. Aim to land and stop using no more than 60% of the available runway length.
		2. If the POH states a landing distance of 1,500 feet, a runway shorter than 2,500 feet may not provide sufficient margin.
## Fuel Management and Range:
1. Understand that range figures are based on no-wind conditions.
2. Fuel consumption is time-based; think in terms of endurance rather than distance.
3. Accurately check fuel levels:
	1. Visually inspect tanks to ensure they are completely full.
	2. Verify the aircraft is on a level surface; check the turn coordinator's ball is centered.
	3. Uneven fueling can result in significant fuel discrepancies.
4. Calculate usable fuel:
	1. Subtract fuel for taxi, takeoff, and climb as specified in the POH.
	2. Subtract an additional hour's worth of fuel at normal cruise for reserve.
	3. Divide remaining fuel by cruise fuel flow to determine safe flight time.
5. Adjust for wind conditions:
	1. Double the forecast headwind to compensate for inaccurate forecasts.
	2. Halve the forecast tailwind to ensure conservative estimates.
## Importance of Adequate Fuel Reserves:
1. Engine failure is the leading cause of accidents in single-engine airplanes.
2. Fuel exhaustion is the primary cause of engine failures.
3. Avoid planning flights with only legal minimum fuel requirements.
4. Prioritize safety by maintaining generous fuel reserves.

Remember, applying conservative margins to your flight planning enhances safety and reduces risks associated with minimal legal compliance.

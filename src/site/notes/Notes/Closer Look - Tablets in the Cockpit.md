# Closer Look - Tablets in the Cockpit
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers the use of tablets in aviation, their benefits, and the importance of understanding traditional flight planning methods for new student pilots.

## Introduction to Tablets in the Cockpit
1. Tablets assist with various aspects of flying:
    1. Plan cross-country flights.
    2. Provide preflight weather briefings.
    3. Display electronic sectional and terminal area charts.
    4. Show GPS moving maps and more.

## Importance of Learning Traditional Flight Planning Methods
1. Flight instructors may teach using traditional tools:
    1. Paper charts, plotter, E6B, pen, and paper.
    2. Tablets may not be used initially.
2. Benefits of learning the "old school method":
    1. Understand fundamental concepts and calculations.
    2. Appreciate the speed and simplicity of tablets.
3. Necessary for the knowledge test:
    1. Calculations must be done by hand.

## Transitioning to Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs)
1. After mastering fundamentals, you can use tablets:
    1. Automate routine calculations.
    2. Replace paper charts with electronic versions.
2. Advantages of using EFBs:
    1. Access to all VFR Sectional and Terminal Area Charts.
    2. No need to carry paper charts or A/FDs.
    3. Display airplane's position on charts with GPS.

## Legal Considerations for Using EFBs
1. Understand regulations:
    1. FAR 91.21: Verify EFB does not cause interference.
    2. Advisory Circular 91-78: Guidance on replacing paper charts.
2. Guidelines from AC 91-78:
    1. Use an application that displays current charts and data.
    2. Update charts every 28 days.
    3. Recommended to have a backup source (paper or second EFB).
    4. Perform an evaluation period before relying solely on the tablet.

## Best Practices for Using Tablets in Flight
1. Secure the tablet properly:
    1. Use a kneeboard to keep it on your leg.
    2. Mount it in the cockpit with a dedicated bracket.
2. Ensure easy operation during all flight phases.
3. Prevent the tablet from falling out of reach, especially in rough air.

## Benefits of Using Tablets
1. Enhance safety and efficiency:
    1. Automate flight planning.
    2. Replace paper charts.
    3. Provide additional capabilities with accessories:
        1. Display in-flight METARs and weather radar.
        2. Show nearby traffic.
        3. Provide backup flight instruments.

## Balanced Approach and Preparedness
1. Do not rely solely on tablets from the beginning.
2. Learn the fundamentals of flight planning by hand.
3. Work with your instructor to balance traditional methods and tablet use.
4. Being proficient in both methods:
    1. Helps identify planning errors.
    2. Prepares you for emergencies.

By understanding both traditional and electronic flight planning methods, you'll be better equipped to utilize tablets effectively while ensuring safety and preparedness in all flight situations.

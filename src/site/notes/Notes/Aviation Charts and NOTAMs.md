This section covers the importance of aviation charts and NOTAMs, essential tools for safe and effective flight planning and navigation for new student pilots.

## Introduction to Aviation Charts:

1. The evolution of navigation charts:
    1. Early aviation relied on visual contact with familiar landmarks.
    2. Advancements led to charts depicting airports and visual landmarks for cross-country flights.
2. Importance of visual navigation charts today:
    1. Crucial for safe flight planning and navigation.
    2. Available in various print and electronic formats.

## Types of Visual Navigation Charts:

1. VFR Sectional Charts:
    1. Designed for visual navigation.
    2. Named after a major city within the coverage area.
    3. Similar to driving maps, making them easier to read.
2. VFR Terminal Area Charts (TAC):
    1. Provide greater detail for congested terminal areas.
    2. Useful for navigating slow and medium-speed aircraft.
3. Flyway Planning Charts:
    1. Printed on the back of some terminal area charts.
    2. Identify flight paths clear of major controlled traffic flows.

## Features of VFR Charts:

1. VFR Waypoints:
    1. Marked with a 4-point star on charts.
    2. Have a 5-letter identifier beginning with "VP".
    3. Pre-programmed into most GPS navigators.
2. Visual Checkpoints:
    1. Marked with a magenta flag.
    2. Can be used to identify your position to ATC.
    3. Use the name of the checkpoint in communications, not the waypoint identifier.
3. Understanding Chart Details:
    1. Chart name and effective dates are prominently displayed.
    2. Ensure you are using up-to-date charts for accurate information.

## Digital Aviation Charts:

1. Advantages of digital charts:
    1. Seamless integration of multiple charts into one layer.
    2. Eliminates the need to carry multiple physical charts.
    3. Easy updates via app downloads.
2. Features when using apps like ForeFlight:
    1. Automatic switching between Sectional and TAC charts when zooming.
    2. Ability to display VFR Flyway charts over the sectional.
    3. Aircraft position displayed on the chart when connected to GPS.
3. Accessing chart legends and side panels:
    1. Not visible by default on digital charts.
    2. Can be viewed by tapping individual charts within the app.

## Chart Supplement (Formerly A/FD):

1. Purpose of the Chart Supplement:
    1. Provides additional information about airports and ATC facilities.
    2. Contains an Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD).
2. Contents of the Chart Supplement:
    1. Detailed runway data and airport remarks.
    2. Communication frequencies and nearby navigation aids.
    3. VOR receiver test information and airport taxiway diagrams.
3. Accessing the Chart Supplement:
    1. Available in nine volumes covering different geographic areas.
    2. Can be accessed in print, PDF format online, or within aviation apps.
    3. Updated every 56 days to ensure current information.

## Understanding NOTAMs (Notices to Air Missions):

1. Purpose of NOTAMs:
    1. Essential for flight safety and preflight planning.
    2. Contain information not known sufficiently in advance for chart publication.
2. Types of NOTAMs:
    1. Domestic NOTAMs (NOTAM D):
        1. Report changes to navaids, runway conditions, and airspace.
        2. Classified by keywords like APRON, RWY, NAV.
    2. Flight Data Center (FDC) NOTAMs:
        1. Contain regulatory information like amendments to procedures.
        2. Include information on temporary flight restrictions (TFRs).
    3. International NOTAMs:
        1. Issued for airports outside of the U.S.
        2. Presented in a standardized international format.
    4. Military NOTAMs:
        1. Intended for military or joint-use facilities.
        2. Also use the international NOTAM format.
3. Accessing NOTAMs:
    1. Available from the FAA NOTAM website, Flight Service, and flight planning apps.
    2. Check NOTAMs during preflight planning for updated safety information.

Remember, understanding and effectively using aviation charts and NOTAMs are critical skills for every pilot, ensuring safe navigation and adherence to regulatory requirements.

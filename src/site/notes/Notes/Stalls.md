# Stalls
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]


This section covers the fundamentals of stalls, their types, how to recognize and recover from them, and emphasizes the importance of practicing stall recovery techniques for new student pilots.

## Introduction to Stalls:

1. Stalls are taught to:
    1. Make you aware of and avoid an impending stall.
    2. Properly recover if you inadvertently stall the airplane.
2. Practicing stalls helps you:
    1. Learn low airspeed flight characteristics of the airplane.
    2. Control the airplane at low airspeeds.
3. Stalls can occur at any:
    1. Attitude.
    2. Power setting.
    3. Airspeed.

## Types of Stalls:

1. Power-Off Stalls (Approach to Landing Stalls):
    1. Simulate approach and landing conditions.
    2. Practiced either as imminent or full stalls.
2. Power-On Stalls (Takeoff and Departure Stalls):
    1. Simulate takeoff and departure situations.
    2. Include stalls with takeoff configuration and climb power settings.
3. Imminent Stalls:
    1. Recovery is made at the first indication of a stall.
    2. Objective is to avoid a full stall.
4. Full Stalls:
    1. Stall is allowed to progress to full aerodynamic stall conditions.
    2. Includes full up elevator, nose-down pitching, high sink rate, and buffeting.
5. Secondary Stalls:
    1. Occur when pitch is raised too soon or too high during recovery.
    2. Recovery by releasing back elevator pressure and regaining airspeed.
6. Accelerated Maneuver Stalls:
    1. Caused by increased load factor during steep turns or abrupt pitch changes.
    2. Stall occurs at a higher airspeed due to increased load.

## Stall Recovery Techniques:

1. Reduce the angle of attack:
    1. Lower the nose to decrease angle of attack.
    2. Add power if available to assist in recovery.
2. Maintain directional control:
    1. Use coordinated rudder and aileron pressures.
    2. Apply right rudder to counteract engine torque and "P-factor" during power-on stalls.
3. Avoid secondary stalls:
    1. Do not raise the nose too quickly during recovery.
    2. Allow airspeed to increase before resuming climb attitude.

## Stall Practice Procedures:

1. Ensure safety:
    1. Practice stalls at safe altitudes (minimum 1,500 feet AGL).
    2. Clear the area with at least two 90-degree turns before starting.
2. Weight and balance considerations:
    1. Properly distribute and balance weight in the airplane.
    2. Avoid loading too far forward or aft to prevent stall issues.
3. Power-Off Stall Procedure:
    1. Reduce power to idle while maintaining altitude to slow down.
    2. Extend flaps as airspeed enters the white arc.
    3. Stabilize at normal approach speed and attitude.
    4. Slowly increase pitch to induce stall.
    5. Recover at first indication (imminent) or after full stall cues.
4. Power-On Stall Procedure:
    1. Reduce power and slow to liftoff or climb speed.
    2. Apply takeoff or climb power while increasing pitch above normal climb attitude.
    3. Maintain coordinated flight using right rudder.
    4. Recover at first indication or after full stall cues.
5. Turning Stalls:
    1. Begin turn with a bank angle not exceeding 20 degrees.
    2. Maintain bank angle during stall entry and recovery.
    3. Be prepared for increased bank tendencies and use appropriate controls.
6. Accelerated Stall Procedure:
    1. Slow to 1.5 times normal stall speed.
    2. Initiate a 45-degree banked turn.
    3. Abruptly increase back elevator pressure to induce stall.
    4. Recover promptly to prevent excessive altitude loss.

## Stalls and Aircraft Weight and Balance:

1. Forward Center of Gravity (CG):
    1. Causes the airplane to stall at a higher airspeed.
    2. Requires more elevator back pressure to maintain altitude.
2. Aft Center of Gravity:
    1. May make stall recovery more difficult.
    2. Reduces the effectiveness of the elevator.

## Load Factor and Stalling:

1. Load Factor:
    1. Refers to stresses on the airframe during flight maneuvers.
    2. Increases during steep turns, pull-ups, and abrupt attitude changes.
2. Effect on Stalls:
    1. Increased load factor causes the airplane to stall at higher airspeeds.
    2. Important to be cautious during maneuvers exceeding 1G.
3. Maneuvering Speed:
    1. Accelerated stalls should be performed at or below this speed.
    2. Helps prevent structural damage during stall recovery.

## Conclusion:

1. Regular practice:
    1. Continue practicing stalls and slow flight even after certification.
    2. Helps maintain proficiency in recognizing and recovering from stalls.
2. Safety awareness:
    1. Understanding stalls is crucial for safe piloting.
    2. Prepares you to handle unexpected stall situations effectively.

Remember, mastering stall recognition and recovery is essential for every pilot to ensure safe and confident flying.

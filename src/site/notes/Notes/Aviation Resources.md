# Aviation acronyms

A list of acronyms that are used here:

* GA - General Aviation. Essentially flying for fun.

* AGL - Above Ground Level

* VFR - Visual Flight Rules. Flying

* IFR - Instrument Flight Rules. Flying under conditions in which flight by outside visual reference is not safe.

# Thank Yous

Thanks from us all to...

* The pioneer to the yester-years: The Wright brothers, Amelia Earhart and countless others who made modern aviation possible.

* The teachers, friends, family and numerous other who help train and support pilots and other aviation careers.

* The future pilot, mechanic, engineer, or dreamer of the flight.

* All the pilots, flight crews, ground and airport staff who fly us all safely from one place to another. You've made aviation en everyday service that we're gotten so used to that if you're a bit off, we complain. So, thanks for putting up with us.

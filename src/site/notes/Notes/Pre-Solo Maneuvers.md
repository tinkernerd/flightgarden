# Pre-Solo Maneuvers
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers pre-solo maneuvers, specifically S-Turns Across a Road and Turns Around a Point, focusing on correcting for wind drift to maintain a prescribed ground track during turning flight.
## Understanding Wind Drift in Turning Flight:
1. Wind drift affects the ground track during turns:
    1. A constant bank turn makes a circle in the air, but the ground track is altered by wind.
    2. Different wind conditions change the shape of the ground path.
2. To make a uniform circle on the ground:
    1. Vary the bank angle to compensate for the wind.
    2. The circle in the air must be adjusted to offset wind drift.

## S-Turns Across a Road:

1. Objective: Make semi-circles of equal size on each side of a straight line on the ground.
2. Select a suitable reference line:
    1. Use roads, railroad tracks, or fence lines at a right angle to the wind.
3. Procedure:
    1. Start the maneuver downwind to manage bank angles effectively.
    2. Cross over the road at a right angle and begin a turn immediately.
        1. Over the road, initiate the steepest bank with a rapid roll into the turn.
    3. Adjust bank and crab angles:
        1. Steepen the bank when heading downwind due to higher groundspeed.
        2. Shallow the bank when heading upwind as groundspeed decreases.
        3. Crab into the wind to maintain the semi-circle's uniformity.
    4. Complete the first semi-circle by crossing the road wings level at a right angle.
    5. Immediately begin the turn in the opposite direction to trace an identical semi-circle on the other side.
4. Maintain a constant altitude between 600 and 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL).

## Turns Around a Point:
1. Objective: Make complete circles around a point on the ground, maintaining a constant distance from it.
2. Point selection:
    1. Choose a prominent but small point for precise reference.
    2. Ideal points include fence line intersections or the center of crossroads.
3. Procedure:
    1. Start the maneuver on a downwind heading for maximum bank angle management.
    2. Adjust bank and crab angles to compensate for wind drift:
        1. Bank is steepest when heading downwind due to higher groundspeed.
        2. Bank is shallowest when heading upwind as groundspeed decreases.
        3. Crab into the wind to maintain a constant radius around the point.
    3. Use intermediate reference points every 90 degrees to help maintain the circle.
    4. Complete two or more circles to fine-tune the maneuver and correct any errors.
4. Maintain a constant altitude between 600 and 1,000 feet AGL.

## Key Considerations:
1. Bank Angle Management:
    1. Steepen the bank when groundspeed increases (downwind).
    2. Shallow the bank when groundspeed decreases (upwind).
2. Crab Angle Adjustment:
    1. Crab into the wind to counteract drift and maintain the desired ground track.
3. Altitude Control:
    1. Maintain constant altitude throughout the maneuvers.
4. Wind Awareness:
    1. Always be aware of wind direction and speed.
    2. Adjust maneuvers accordingly to compensate for wind effects.

By mastering these pre-solo maneuvers, you will enhance your pilotage skills, specifically in handling wind drift during turning flight, which is essential for safe and precise flying.

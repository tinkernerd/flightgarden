# Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs)
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers the importance of Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs), how they are generated, interpreted, and accessed, providing essential real-time weather information for pilots.

## Introduction to PIREPs:

1. Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs) are real-time weather reports made directly from the flight deck.
    1. Provide actual observations of cloud, icing, and turbulence conditions.
    2. Generated when a pilot reports observed conditions to ATC or through other means.
2. Benefits of PIREPs:
    1. Help pilots with flight planning and preparation.
    2. Assist aviation weather forecasters in assessing and updating current forecasts.

## Types of PIREPs:

1. Two main types:
    1. Urgent PIREPs (UUA):
        1. Issued for severe or extreme turbulence, severe icing, tornadoes, hail, low-level wind shear, volcanic ash, or other hazardous conditions.
    2. Routine PIREPs (UA):
        2. Contain non-urgent information relevant to flight operations.

## Understanding PIREP Format:

1. PIREPs are presented in a standardized, coded text format similar to other weather products.
2. Key elements in a PIREP:
    1. Location: Given in relation to a known geographic designation or VOR radial and distance.
    2. Time: Reported in Zulu (UTC) time.
    3. Altitude/Flight Level: Indicated altitude of the report.
    4. Aircraft Type: Helps determine the relevance of the report to other pilots.
    5. Weather Conditions: Reports on sky conditions, turbulence, icing, etc.
3. Missing elements are omitted from the report.

## Interpreting PIREPs:

1. Importance of aircraft type in PIREPs:
    1. Helps pilots assess the usefulness and validity of the report.
    2. Example: Moderate turbulence reported by a Cessna 172 may not affect a Boeing 787, but severe turbulence reported by a large aircraft is crucial for smaller aircraft.
2. Examples of PIREPs:
    1. Over Boston at 1444Z during climb, reported by a Boeing 787:
        1. Scattered clouds with bases at 2,300 MSL and overcast at 3,000 MSL.
        2. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) at 10,000 MSL.
    2. Urgent PIREP near Great Falls, Montana at 1550Z by a Cessna 310:
        1. Freezing rain and light rime icing between 10,000 and 11,000 MSL.

## Accessing PIREPs:

1. Aviation Weather Center website (aviationweather.gov):
    1. Standard map displays weather overlays including PIREPs.
    2. Layers can be customized to show PIREPs and radar.
    3. PIREPs are depicted with symbols, numbers, and colors representing various weather conditions and altitudes.
    4. Clicking a PIREP displays the full text, including decoded data and raw report.
2. Using aviation apps (e.g., ForeFlight):
    1. Enable the PIREPs layer on the moving map to view reports.
    2. Tap on a PIREP to view detailed information in both raw and decoded formats.

## Contributing PIREPs:

1. Pilots should report any observations, good or bad, to assist others.
    1. Include observations where conditions were forecasted but not encountered.
2. Reporting improves flight safety and accuracy of weather forecasts.

Remember, by providing timely and accurate PIREPs, pilots play a crucial role in enhancing safety and efficiency in aviation for everyone.

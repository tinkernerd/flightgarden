# When Should You Fly?
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section discusses the important factors a student pilot should consider when deciding whether to fly, focusing on weather conditions, time of day, and the fundamentals of flight training.

## The Go/No-Go Decision:
- Understand that the go/no-go decision is crucial before each flight.
    - Even as a student pilot, you should participate in this decision with your instructor.
- Consider several factors when making this decision:
    - Weather conditions are a primary factor.

## Weather Considerations:

### Each season has advantages and disadvantages:
#### Summer:
- Offers warm weather and many flyable days.
- Be cautious of summer storms; delay lessons if storms are near.
#### Winter:
- Provides the clearest air and peak aircraft performance due to denser cold air.
- Wind conditions can be challenging, especially for beginners.
### Visibility:
- For VFR training, the minimum practical visibility is 3 miles.
- It's preferable to train in conditions with better visibility.
### Wind Conditions:
- Brisk winds may be a reason to postpone early flight lessons.
- Crosswinds can be challenging when runways don't align with the wind.
- You'll learn to handle crosswinds as you progress in training.
### Cloud Cover:
- VFR minimum ceiling height is 1,000 feet above ground level.
- Prefer higher ceilings for training flights.
- Understanding cloud terms:
	- "Ceiling" is the lowest cloud layer covering most of the sky.
	- "Overcast" means the sky is completely covered with clouds.
	- "Broken" ceiling indicates an overcast with some breaks or holes.
### Collaborate with your instructor:
- Assess weather conditions together to determine flight suitability.
- Weather will be studied in more depth in later lessons.

## Flight Training Year-Round:
- Training in different seasons prepares you for year-round flying.
    - Each season offers unique learning opportunities.

## Day vs. Night Flying:
- Begin training during daylight hours:
    - Clear visibility of the horizon and external references is essential.
- Night training comes later:
    - Necessary for private pilot certification.
    - Skills learned during the day apply to night flying.

## Fundamentals of Flight Training:
### This volume introduces:
- The aircraft and its systems and controls.
- Basic aerodynamics.
- Preflight procedures.
- Engine start and taxiing.
- Basic communications.
#### The four basic maneuvers fundamental to flight training:
- Climbs.
- Descents.
- Straight-and-level flight.
- Turns.

Remember, no matter when you fly, mastering these fundamentals is essential for your progress as a pilot.

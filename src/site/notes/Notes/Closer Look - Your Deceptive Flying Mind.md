> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section explores mental challenges that pilots may face, emphasizing the importance of awareness and proper decision-making to ensure safe flying.

## Auto-Rough:

1. Description:
    1. A perceived engine malfunction without any actual mechanical issues.
    2. Commonly occurs at night, over rough terrain, or when flying beyond gliding distance from land.
2. Characteristics:
    1. The engine sounds like it's making unusual noises or running rough.
    2. Instruments show normal readings; others may not notice any problems.
3. Response:
    1. Relax and trust your instruments.
    2. Recognize it as a form of well-intentioned paranoia.

## Get-There-Itis:

1. Description:
    1. A dangerous fixation on reaching the destination despite adverse conditions.
2. Symptoms:
    1. Ignoring threatening weather developments.
    2. Deciding to proceed despite knowing it's unsafe.
    3. Overestimating fuel range and skipping planned fuel stops.
3. Dangers:
    1. Fuel exhaustion leading to engine failure.
    2. Compromised safety due to poor decision-making.
4. Prevention:
    1. Prioritize safety over convenience.
    2. Adhere strictly to pre-flight planning and fuel management.

## "I Made It Last Time":

1. Description:
    1. Also known as "Normalization of Deviance."
    2. Developing complacency after previous flights in unsafe conditions.
2. Dangers:
    1. Mistaking luck for skill.
    2. Gradual acceptance of unsafe practices as normal.
3. Prevention:
    1. Recognize that past success does not guarantee future safety.
    2. Consistently follow safety protocols regardless of previous outcomes.

## Expectation Bias:

1. Description:
    1. Hearing or seeing what you expect rather than what is actually communicated.
2. Examples:
    2. Mistaking a controller's instructions due to routine expectations.
    3. Entering the wrong traffic pattern because it's the usual procedure.
3. Prevention:
    1. Listen carefully to communication from ATC.
    2. Avoid making assumptions; confirm instructions when in doubt.

Remember, staying vigilant about these mental challenges is crucial for safe and successful flying. Always prioritize safety over convenience, trust your training, and maintain clear communication.

# Air Facts: Fit for Flight
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section emphasizes the importance of self-assessment and ensuring personal fitness before flying. It covers factors like health conditions, medications, fatigue, and alcohol consumption that can affect a pilot's ability to fly safely.

## Self-Certification:

1. FAA Medical Requirements:
    1. Pilots must visit an FAA medical examiner periodically.
    2. Examiners look for any disqualifying conditions as per regulations.
2. Daily Self-Assessment:
    1. Pilots must self-certify fitness every day they fly.
    2. Go beyond minimum rules to ensure safe operation.

## Health Considerations:

1. Common Illnesses:
    1. Colds can cause ear problems during ascent and descent due to congestion.
    2. Feeling unwell can be a distraction while flying.
2. Medications:
    1. Antihistamines can cause grogginess; avoid flying when taking them.
    2. Always consult your aviation medical examiner about medications before flying.
3. Mental Clarity:
    1. If illness affects concentration or focus, it's best not to fly.

## Fatigue:

1. Impact on Performance:
    1. A tired pilot is not a good pilot.
    2. Fatigue affects decision-making and flying skills.
2. Professional Standards:
    1. Airlines limit pilot duty hours to manage fatigue.
    2. Effects of fatigue build over time; adequate rest is essential.

## Alcohol Consumption:

1. FAA Regulations:
    1. No flying within 8 hours of consuming alcohol.
    2. Blood alcohol level must be below 0.04%.
2. Personal Responsibility:
    1. FAA limits are minimal; personal judgment is crucial.
    2. Alcohol affects individuals differently; assess your condition thoroughly.
3. Industry Norms:
    1. Professional pilots adhere to a 12-hour rule ("bottle to throttle").

Always prioritize safety by ensuring you are physically and mentally fit to fly. It's better to be on the ground wishing to fly than in the air wishing you were on the ground.

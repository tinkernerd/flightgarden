# Air Facts - Engine TLC
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section emphasizes the importance of treating airplane engines with care and understanding best practices for engine operation to ensure longevity and safe flying.

## Respect for Engines:

- Understanding engine mechanics is valuable, but:
    - You don't need to know every component's action during flight.
    - Focus on proper engine operation and handling.
- Good pilots develop a healthy respect for their engines.

## Tender Loving Care (TLC) for Engines:

- Engines perform better and last longer when treated with care.
- Smooth throttle movements are essential:
    - Avoid rapid or rough throttle inputs.
    - Be gentle and gradual with throttle adjustments.
- Airplane engines are more sensitive than car engines:
    - Require gradual temperature changes.
    - Need proper warm-up before applying high power.

## Engine Warm-up Procedures:

- After engine start:
    - Let the engine run for a minute or so before taxiing.
    - Allows cylinder head temperature to rise gradually.
    - Warms up oil for adequate lubrication.
    - Especially important in cold weather.
- Cold oil considerations:
    - Can result in excessive oil pressure at high power settings.
- Rule of thumb for takeoff:
    - Do not use full power for takeoff less than:
        - Four minutes after startup in warm weather.
        - Six minutes after startup in cold weather.
    - Ensures engine oil is warm and lubrication is complete.
    - Refer to your Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) for specific guidance.

## Reliability and Economical Aspects:

- Aircraft engines are reliable and economical despite their cost.
- Example â€“ Skyhawk engine:
    - Good for 2,000 hours between overhauls.
    - Equivalent to over 200,000 miles.
    - Can last even longer with proper care.

Remember, treating your engine with care not only enhances its performance but also ensures safety during your flights.

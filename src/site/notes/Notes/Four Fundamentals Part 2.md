# Four Fundamentals Part 2
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]


This section covers the essentials of straight and level flight, climbs, and descents, focusing on techniques for maintaining control and precision in aircraft operation.

## Straight and Level Flight:

- Straight and level flight involves maintaining a constant heading and altitude.
- Maintaining level flight:
    - Select a pitch attitude that keeps a reference point on the nose aligned with the horizon.
    - This reference point varies with pilot's eye level and seat position.
    - Use wing and wingtip positions as additional pitch attitude cues.
- Divide attention to prevent fixed stare and to scan for other aircraft.
- Use the altimeter to verify altitude is maintained:
    - If gaining altitude, apply forward pressure to lower the nose.
    - If descending, apply back pressure to raise the nose.
    - Trim the aircraft to relieve control pressure.
- Use the attitude indicator when the horizon isn't visible.
- Monitor other instruments for cues:
    - The airspeed indicator should remain constant in level flight.
    - Significant changes indicate pitch or power adjustments are needed.
    - The vertical speed indicator shows rate of climb or descent but has a lag.
- Understand the relationship between power, pitch, airspeed, and altitude:
    - Changing power without changing pitch affects climb or descent.
    - Changing pitch without changing power affects airspeed.
- Flying straight:
    - Select ground reference points to maintain direction.
    - Use headings parallel or perpendicular to roads, fences, or field boundaries.
    - Use the heading indicator to ensure a constant direction.
- Ensure wings are level:
    - Visually check wingtip positions relative to the horizon.
    - Use the attitude indicator and heading indicator for confirmation.
- Use instruments to maintain straight flight:
    - The attitude indicator shows changes in bank.
    - The heading indicator shows indirect bank through heading changes.
    - The turn coordinator indicates turns and aids in maintaining straight flight.
    - The inclinometer (ball) shows coordinated flight; center the ball.
- Trim the aircraft properly to maintain attitude without constant control pressure.
- Avoid common errors:
    - Resting arm on the control yoke causing unintended bank.
    - Holding unnecessary aileron or rudder pressure.

## Climbs:

- A climb is a maneuver where pitch and power allow the aircraft to gain altitude.
- Normal climb:
    - The most efficient combination of airspeed and power for altitude gain.
    - Used to achieve the best rate of climb.
- Initiating a climb:
    - Simultaneously apply back pressure on the elevator and set throttle for climb power.
    - As airspeed decreases to climb speed (approximately 77 knots for the Skyhawk), increase right rudder pressure to compensate for left-turning tendency.
    - Use rudder, not aileron, to maintain straight flight and reduce drag.
- Climb attitude and airspeed:
    - Use a pitch reference point and the attitude indicator to maintain climb attitude.
    - Check the airspeed indicator to maintain the proper climb speed.
    - Scan the airspace for other aircraft while dividing attention among references.
- Adjusting airspeed during climb:
    - If airspeed is too low, lower the pitch attitude.
    - If airspeed is too high, raise the pitch attitude.
- Climbing turns:
    - Use shallow banks to minimize reduction in climb rate.
    - More back elevator pressure is needed to maintain climb attitude.
    - Use increased rudder pressure for coordination due to down aileron drag.
- Leveling off from a climb:
    - Start level-off about 50 feet before the desired altitude.
    - Gradually lower the nose to the level flight attitude to prevent altitude overshoot or loss.
    - Maintain climb power until airspeed approaches cruise speed, then set cruise power.
- Trim the aircraft to relieve control pressures during climb.

## Descents:

- Descents can be made at various airspeeds and rates.
- Normal glide (low or idle power descent):
    - Used during landing approach.
    - Provides the greatest forward travel for altitude lost.
    - Recommended glide speed is approximately 65 knots for training aircraft.
- Initiating a descent:
    - Reduce power and apply back pressure to maintain altitude initially.
    - Allow airspeed to decrease to glide speed, then lower pitch attitude to maintain this speed.
    - Trim the aircraft for hands-off flight.
- Adjusting glide:
    - If airspeed is too high, raise the pitch attitude.
    - If airspeed is too low, lower the pitch attitude.
    - Use airspeed indicator to fine-tune adjustments.
- Use of instruments and trimming:
    - Establish pitch attitude using the horizon or attitude indicator.
    - Trim the aircraft to maintain the glide attitude without control pressure.
- Effects on controls during glide:
    - Controls are less effective; more input may be needed.
    - May need left rudder pressure to maintain straight flight due to reduced propeller slipstream.
    - Ailerons remain effective; use appropriate control inputs.
- Clearing the engine:
    - During prolonged idle descents, briefly increase throttle to around 1500 RPM every 30 seconds.
- Leveling off from a descent:
    - Start level-off 50 to 100 feet before the desired altitude, depending on rate of descent.
    - Apply cruise power as the desired altitude is approached.
    - Adjust pitch to level flight attitude, coordinating altitude and airspeed smoothly.

Diligent practice of these maneuvers forms the foundation for more advanced flight training.

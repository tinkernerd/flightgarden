# The Flight Deck
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section provides an introduction to the flight deck, covering the cockpit layout, different types of instrument panels, the flight and engine instruments, and the importance of familiarizing oneself with the airplane's controls and systems.

## Cockpit Overview:

### Most training airplanes have fully functioning dual controls:
- Can be flown from either side.
- Traditionally, the pilot flies from the left seat.
### Two types of instrument panels:
- Conventional mechanical round gauges (analog instruments).
- Glass panel with flat panel computer screens (digital displays).
### Layout of a conventional instrument panel (e.g., Cessna 172):
#### Left side:
- Flight, navigation, and engine instruments.
- Electrical switches and circuit breakers.
#### Middle:
- Radios.
- Engine controls.
- Fuel controls.
- Flaps and trim controls.
#### Right side:
- Cabin environment controls.
- Hour meter.
- Space for options.

## Flight Instruments:

### Primary flight instruments:
#### Airspeed Indicator
- Measures speed in knots (nautical miles per hour).
- Speed ranges and limitations are marked:
	- Red line: Never exceed speed.
	- Yellow arc: Caution range (smooth air only).
	- Green arc: Normal operating range.
	- White arc: Flap operating range.
- Attitude Indicator
	- Uses a gyroscope to stabilize a horizon bar.
	- Displays pitch and bank relative to the natural horizon.
- Altimeter
	- Measures altitude above sea level. 
	- Uses rotating hands similar to a clock: 
		- Short hand: Thousands of feet. 
		- Long hand: Hundreds of feet.
		- Diamond-shaped indicator: Tens of thousands of feet. 
	- Must be set prior to every flight due to changing barometric pressure.
- Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)
	- Measures rate of climb or descent in feet per minute.
- Turn Coordinator
	- Provides information about direction and rate of turn.
	- Inclinometer (ball) shows quality of the turn (coordination).
- Heading Indicator (Directional Gyro)
	- Main directional instrument used in flight.
	- Gyroscopically stabilized; not affected by banks, turns, or speed changes.
	- Must be set to the compass before takeoff and adjusted during flight.
- Magnetic Compass
	- Shows aircraft heading relative to magnetic north.
	- Affected by banks, turns, and speed changes; used in conjunction with the heading indicator.

## Engine Instruments and Controls:

### Engine Controls:
#### Throttle
- Controls engine power by regulating airflow into the engine.
- Push forward to increase power; pull back to decrease.
-  Throttle friction lock adjusts ease of movement.
#### Mixture Control
- Regulates fuel-to-air ratio.
- Push forward to enrich mixture; pull back to lean.
#### Engine Instruments:
##### Tachometer
- Indicates engine RPM (revolutions per minute).
- Marked to show maximum permissible RPM.
##### Oil Pressure and Temperature Gauges
- Monitor engine health and operation.
#####  Fuel Flow Gauge
-  Shows fuel consumption in gallons per hour.
##### Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) Gauge
- Helps in setting the proper mixture.
#### Other Controls and Indicators:
##### Flap Control
- Controls the position of wing flaps.
	- Positions at 10°, 20°, and 30°.
##### Elevator Trim Control
- Adjusts the neutral position of the elevator to relieve control pressure.
- Rotate forward for nose-down trim; aft for nose-up trim.
##### Fuel Selector
- Selects fuel tank(s): Left tank, right tank, or both.
- Includes a separate fuel shutoff valve.
##### Vacuum Gauge
- Monitors the operation of engine-driven vacuum pumps powering gyroscopic instruments.
##### Electrical System:
- Switches and circuit breakers for electrical components.
##### Voltmeter, Clock, and Outside Air Temperature Gauge
- Important for navigation and weather considerations.

## Glass Cockpit Systems:

### Digital Flight Displays (e.g., Garmin G1000):
#### Primary Flight Display (PFD)
- Displays flight instruments digitally.
- Large attitude indicator across the screen.
- Airspeed indicator on the left as a digital tape.
- Altimeter on the right as a digital tape.
- Vertical speed indicator and heading indicator also displayed.
#### Multi-Function Display (MFD)
- Shows engine instruments and GPS moving map.
- Engine instruments displayed on the left side.
- GPS moving map aids in navigation and flight planning.
#### Integrated Communication and Navigation Radios:
- Located at the top of both PFD and MFD.
- Operated through the digital interface.
#### Further training on digital systems will be provided later.

## Importance of Familiarization:

- Spend time sitting in the airplane to learn:
	- The position of switches, instruments, and gauges.
	- The layout of controls and panels.
- Benefits of familiarization:
	- Allows you to concentrate on flying the airplane.
	- Builds confidence and reduces in-flight workload.
-  Investing time in getting to know your airplane is time well spent.

By understanding the flight deck layout and instruments, you'll be better prepared for your training flights. Familiarization with both traditional and modern cockpit systems is essential for a successful learning experience.

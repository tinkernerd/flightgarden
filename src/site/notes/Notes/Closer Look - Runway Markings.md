# Closer Look - Runway Markings
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section provides an overview of common runway markings that every new pilot should understand to ensure safe and proper aircraft operations.

## Displaced Threshold:

1. The threshold is the designated beginning of the runway available for landing.
2. Sometimes, the threshold is displaced and not at the very beginning of the pavement:
    1. Touchdown should not occur before the displaced threshold.
    2. Reasons for displacement:
        1. Obstacle clearance.
        2. Pavement stability.
        3. Noise abatement.
    3. The paved area before the displaced threshold can be used for:
        1. Taxiing.
        2. Landing rollout.
        3. Beginning of takeoff roll.

## Blast Pad / Stopway:

1. Some runways have an extension marked with yellow chevrons:
    1. Known as a blast pad or stopway.
    2. Not usable for normal operations due to structural limitations.

## Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS):

1. Found at larger airports.
2. Located in the safety area beyond the end of the runway.
3. Constructed of high-energy absorbing materials to assist in aircraft deceleration in case of an overrun.
4. EMAS locations are identifiable on airport diagrams.

## Closed Runways:

1. A large "X" at either end of a runway indicates it is closed:
    1. Could be a permanent marking for closed airports.
    2. Could be temporary for special events or runway maintenance.

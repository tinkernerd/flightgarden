# PPL Regulations
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) relevant to student pilots preparing for solo cross-country flights, including the required aeronautical experience, flight proficiency, planning, and regulations to ensure safety during cross-country flights.

## Aeronautical Experience Requirements

1. You must receive at least 20 hours of flight instruction, including:
    1. At least 3 hours of cross-country flight training.
2. The cross-country training must include:
    2. One night cross-country flight over 100 nautical miles.
3. You need 10 hours of solo flight time, including:
    1. At least 5 hours of solo cross-country flights.
    2. Each solo cross-country flight must have a landing more than 50 nautical miles from the original departure point.
    3. One solo flight must be at least 150 nautical miles, with full-stop landings at a minimum of 3 points, and at least one segment of 50 nautical miles or more.

## Flight Proficiency Requirements

1. Obtain an endorsement in your logbook from an authorized flight instructor attesting that you are competent in cross-country flying.
2. Demonstrate proficiency in:
    1. Pilotage (navigating by visual references).
    2. Dead reckoning (calculating position based on course, speed, time, and distance).
    3. Using navigation systems.
3. Be familiar with:
    1. Obtaining pertinent weather reports.
    2. Flight planning, including plotting courses, estimating times en route, and fuel requirements.

## Fuel Requirements

1. For daytime VFR flights, you must have enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing, plus at least 30 minutes at normal cruising speed.
2. For nighttime VFR flights, you must have enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing, plus at least 45 minutes at normal cruising speed.

## Instructor Endorsements for Cross-Country Flights

1. Your instructor may endorse your logbook for repeated solo cross-country flights over a course less than 50 nautical miles from the point of departure.
2. Requirements for such an endorsement:
    1. You have received instruction in both directions over the route.
    2. Includes takeoffs and landings at the airports to be used.

## VFR Cruising Altitudes

1. When flying under VFR in level cruising flight more than 3,000 feet above the surface, you must maintain the appropriate altitude based on your magnetic course:
2. Magnetic course of 0째 through 179째:
    1. Maintain odd thousand foot MSL altitudes plus 500 feet (e.g., 3,500 ft, 5,500 ft).
3. Magnetic course of 180째 through 359째:
    1. Maintain even thousand foot MSL altitudes plus 500 feet (e.g., 4,500 ft, 6,500 ft).

## Flight Planning and Preparation

1. Cross-country flying begins and ends on the ground; thorough planning is essential.
2. Before any cross-country flight, you must:
    1. Obtain and analyze pertinent weather reports and forecasts.
    2. Prepare a flight plan, including plotting courses and waypoints.
    3. Estimate times en route and fuel required.

Understanding and adhering to the Federal Aviation Regulations is crucial for your safety and success as a student pilot. Proper preparation, proficiency, and compliance with regulations ensure that your cross-country flights are conducted safely and efficiently.

# Thunderstorms and Convective Forecasts
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers the importance of understanding thunderstorms and how to interpret convective forecasts to ensure safe flying practices for new pilots.

## Introduction to Thunderstorms:

1. Thunderstorms are significant weather conditions that pilots must respect and avoid.
    1. They can cause mayhem and damage to aircraft.
    2. Even commercial airlines detour or delay flights to avoid thunderstorms.

## Formation of Thunderstorms:

1. Three conditions required for a thunderstorm to form:
    1. Unstable air.
    2. High moisture content.
    3. A source of lift.
2. If any of these conditions are missing, a thunderstorm will not form.
3. High temperatures are not necessary for thunderstorm formation.
    1. Thunderstorms can occur during winter but are less frequent.

## Life Cycle of Thunderstorms:

1. Thunderstorms have three stages:
    1. **Cumulus Stage:**
        1. Begins as cumulus clouds.
        2. Consists entirely of updrafts.
    2. **Mature Stage:**
        1. Starts when the first precipitation falls.
        2. Characterized by both updrafts and downdrafts.
        3. All hazards intensify during this stage.
    3. **Dissipating Stage:**
        1. Downdrafts expand and occupy the entire cell.
        2. The thunderstorm begins to die out.
2. Types of thunderstorms:
    1. **Air Mass Thunderstorms:**
        1. Can be observed passing through all three stages.
    2. **Steady State Thunderstorms:**
        1. Found along fronts and pre-frontal squall lines.
        2. Continually regenerate and exist in all three stages simultaneously.
        3. Leading edge is in the cumulus stage.
        4. Center is in the mature stage.
        5. Trailing edge is dissipating.

## Hazards of Thunderstorms:

1. Thunderstorms present multiple hazards to pilots:
    1. **Turbulence:**
        1. Present in all thunderstorms.
        2. Strongest where updrafts and downdrafts meet (shear zones).
        3. Shear turbulence can be encountered in clear air up to 20 miles from the storm.
    2. **Downdrafts:**
        1. Caused by air dragged down with precipitation.
        2. May exceed the climb performance of general aviation aircraft.
        3. Lead to strong gusty surface winds and microbursts.
        4. Cause dangerous low-level wind shear.
    3. **Hail:**
        1. Possible with any thunderstorm.
        2. Especially common beneath the anvil top of large mature thunderstorms.
        3. Formed by ice particles cycling through updrafts and downdrafts, growing larger.
        4. Hailstones can weigh up to 2 pounds.
        5. Large hail can fall in clear air several miles from a thunderstorm.
    4. **Low Ceilings and Visibility:**
        1. Caused by precipitation and dust between cloud base and ground.
        2. Compounded by turbulence, hail, and lightning.
    5. **Lightning:**
        1. Always present in thunderstorms.
        2. Can cause temporary blindness.
        3. May puncture aircraft skin and damage avionics.
    6. **Altimeter Errors:**
        1. Thunderstorms are intense, small-scale low-pressure systems.
        2. Can cause significant altimeter errors due to changing surface pressure.

## Convective Outlook Forecasts:

1. Issued by the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.
    1. National forecasts outlining areas where severe thunderstorms may develop.
2. Types of Convective Outlooks:
    1. **Day 1 Outlook:**
        1. Covers the first 24-hour period.
        2. Issued 5 times daily.
        3. Valid until 12Z the following day.
    2. **Day 2 Outlook:**
        1. Covers the second 24-hour period.
        2. Issued twice daily.
    3. **Day 3 Outlook:**
        1. Covers the next 24-hour period after Day 2.
    4. **Day 4–8 Outlook:**
        1. Covers the following five days.
3. Forecast Areas and Risk Levels:
    1. General thunderstorms area depicted with light green shading (10% or greater chance).
    2. Severe weather risks indicated by color shading:
        1. Dark Green: Marginal Risk.
        2. Yellow: Slight Risk.
        3. Orange: Enhanced Risk.
        4. Red: Moderate Risk.
        5. Magenta: High Risk.
    3. Risk labels indicate potential coverage and number of severe thunderstorms, not their intensity.
4. Convective outlooks include a text summary describing the expected severe weather.

## Convective SIGMETs:

1. Provide timely information on active thunderstorm systems.
    1. Deal specifically with convective conditions and thunderstorms.
2. Convective SIGMET Details:
    1. Issued hourly, with unscheduled bulletins as needed.
    2. If no convective activity is observed or forecasted, the bulletin states "None."
    3. Issued for:
        1. Lines of thunderstorms.
        2. Embedded thunderstorms.
        3. Thunderstorms of very strong or greater intensity affecting 40% or more of an area.
        4. Tornadoes.
        5. Thunderstorms with surface winds ≥ 50 knots.
        6. Hail ≥ 3/4 inch diameter.
3. Example of a Convective SIGMET:
    1. **Convective SIGMET 45C:**
        1. Issued at 1655Z, valid until 1855Z.
        2. For Iowa and Nebraska.
        3. Line of severe thunderstorms 20 miles wide moving from 220 degrees at 35 knots.
        4. Tops above 45,000 feet.
        5. Tornadoes, hail up to 3 inches, and wind gusts up to 70 knots are possible.

Remember, always stay informed about thunderstorm activity and convective forecasts to ensure a safe flight.

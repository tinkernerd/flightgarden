# Change of Scenery
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]



It's normal for student pilots to occasionally feel less excited about repetitive training maneuvers. This section provides suggestions to revitalize your enthusiasm by introducing variety into your flight lessons.

## Embrace a Change of Scenery:

1. Fly to a new airport:
    1. Visit airports with on-field restaurants to enjoy a meal with your instructor.
    2. Experience cross-country flying with your instructor's guidance, even if you haven't formally learned it yet.
2. Schedule lessons at different times:
    1. If you usually fly in the afternoon, try morning flights when the air is cooler and calmer.
    2. If you typically fly during the week, consider weekend lessons when you may have fewer distractions.
3. Practice landings at different airports:
    1. If based at a non-towered airport:
        1. Fly to a towered airport to experience controlled airspace and air traffic control communications.
        2. Your instructor can handle radio communications while you focus on flying.
    2. If based at a towered airport:
        1. Visit a non-towered airport to practice flexible traffic patterns.
        2. Use shorter runways to refine your speed and touchdown control.

## Communicate with Your Instructor:

1. Be open about wanting to vary your lessons for increased engagement.
2. Your instructor can tailor your training to keep it enjoyable and productive.

A change of scenery can remind you of the joy of flying and help you acquire valuable skills along the way.

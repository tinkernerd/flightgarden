# Cross-Country Flight Planning with iPad
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section provides guidance on planning cross-country flights using both traditional methods and modern electronic tools, focusing on how to effectively use ForeFlight on an iPad for flight planning.

## Introduction to Cross-Country Flight Planning

1. Begin with traditional planning methods:
    1. Use paper sectional charts, plotters, and E6B flight computers.
    2. Complete a paper navigation log with detailed flight calculations.
    3. Understand the purpose and logic behind each calculation.
2. Transition to electronic planning resources:
    1. Utilize apps like ForeFlight on an iPad for convenience and accuracy.
    2. Ensure performance data is accurate for reliable results.

## Setting Up an Aircraft Profile in ForeFlight

1. Create a new aircraft profile:
    1. Access the Aircraft section in ForeFlight.
    2. Enter the aircraft's tail number (N#) and type.
    3. Additional fields can be completed later as needed (e.g., VFR flight plans, weight and balance).
2. Input performance data:
    1. Tap the Performance Profile button.
    2. Enter climb, cruise, and descent performance data from the airplane's flight manual.
    3. Adjust data for each flight based on conditions and selected cruise altitude.
3. Using ForeFlight Performance Profiles (if available):
    1. Access detailed performance data for your specific aircraft model.
    2. Ensure you select the exact model to account for variations in performance data.

## Planning the Route

1. Enter departure and destination airports:
    1. Navigate to the Maps page.
    2. Open the Route Editor and input the airports.
    3. ForeFlight will draw a magenta line representing your course.
2. Set the planned departure time:
    1. Tap the Time button to enter your expected takeoff time.
    2. Ensure you're connected to the internet for current weather data.
    3. This allows ForeFlight to use accurate winds aloft forecasts in calculations.
3. Select the aircraft profile and cruise altitude:
    1. Tap the airplane button in the Route Editor to select your aircraft profile.
    2. Adjust performance data if necessary for current conditions.
    3. Select VFR and the correct direction of flight to display appropriate altitude options.
4. Review key performance numbers:
    1. Distance, estimated time en route, estimated time of arrival, fuel burn, and wind components are displayed.

## Selecting Visual Checkpoints

1. Choose landmarks every 10 to 15 miles:
    1. Use the map to identify visual landmarks (e.g., lakes, roads, towns).
    2. These serve as visual checkpoints during the flight.
2. Add waypoints in ForeFlight:
    1. Use two fingers on the map to activate the Ruler Tool and measure distances.
    2. Tap and hold on the map to add a waypoint at the selected checkpoint.
    3. Name the waypoints for easy reference (e.g., "Lake North Shore").
3. Ensure waypoints align with your course line:
    1. Keep waypoints on the direct course to maintain consistent headings.
    2. Minor deviations can alter heading calculations between legs.
4. Use map annotations (optional):
    1. Draw landmarks directly on the map for visual reference.

## Reviewing the Navigation Log

1. Access the NavLog:
    1. Tap the NavLog button in the Route Editor.
    2. Review navigation details for each leg between checkpoints.
2. Understand heading calculations:
    1. The magnetic heading accounts for wind aloft and magnetic variation.
    2. Further adjust for compass deviation using your aircraft's compass correction card.
    3. This determines the final compass heading to fly.

## Preparing for the Flight

1. Disable "Ownship" display to hide your GPS position:
    1. Go to ForeFlight's main settings.
    2. In the Preferences section, disable "Enable Ownship".
    3. This encourages navigation using visual references and planned headings.
2. Focus on pilotage and dead reckoning:
    1. Rely on visual landmarks and compass headings.
    2. Develop essential navigation skills and confidence.
    3. Keep your attention outside the cockpit for situational awareness.

By mastering both traditional and modern flight planning techniques, you'll build a strong foundation in navigation. After your training, you'll be able to fully utilize GPS and moving map features for enhanced situational awareness.

# Airport Signs and Markings
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers the importance of runway safety, understanding airport signs and markings, and best practices for new student pilots to navigate airports safely.

## Introduction to Runway Safety:

1. Importance of runway safety in aviation:
    1. Historical accidents highlight the need for vigilance (e.g., Tenerife collision).
2. Understanding communication requirements at airports.
3. Safely moving around when taxiing, taking off, and landing.

## Airport Diagrams and Resources:

1. Use FAA airport diagrams for controlled airports:
    1. Shows parking areas, taxiways, and runways.
2. Access diagrams in the Chart Supplement or aviation apps.
3. ForeFlight provides custom diagrams for most U.S. airports.
4. Always keep the airport diagram accessible when taxiing.

## Signs, Markings, and Lighting Systems:

1. Non-Movement Area Boundary:
    1. Defined by two yellow lines (one solid, one dashed).
    2. No ATC clearance needed within this area.
2. Taxiway Signs and Markings:
    1. Taxiway direction signs: black letter on yellow background with arrows.
    2. Taxiway location signs: yellow letter on black background.
    3. Yellow centerline and edge markings on taxiways.
3. Hold Short Markings for Intersecting Taxiways:
    1. Single dashed yellow line.
    2. Stop before this line if instructed by ATC.
4. Runway Hold Short Markings and Signs:
    1. Four yellow lines (two solid, two dashed); solid lines on taxiway side.
    2. Red runway holding position sign with runway numbers.
    3. Must receive ATC clearance before crossing.
5. Enhanced Centerline Markings:
    1. Alerts pilots of an upcoming runway (additional dashed lines parallel to centerline).
6. Runway Guard Lights:
    1. Elevated flashing yellow lights on both sides of taxiway.
    2. In-pavement flashing yellow lights before hold short line.
7. Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical Area:
    1. Identified by red "ILS" sign and yellow ladder marking on taxiway.
    2. Hold short when instructed by ATC.
8. Runway Approach Area Hold Short Markings:
    1. Red sign with "APCH" and runway numbers.
    2. Hold short when instructed by ATC.
9. Displaced Thresholds:
    1. Identified by white arrows leading to a solid white threshold bar.
    2. Area before threshold used for takeoff but not landing.
    3. Depicted on airport diagrams with ovals and distance information.
10. Taxiways Leading to Runways:
    1. Yellow centerline and edge markings leading to yellow chevrons.
    2. Begin takeoff after the solid demarcation bar.
11. Runway Distance Remaining Signs:
    1. Black signs with white numerals indicating thousands of feet remaining.

## Exiting the Runway:

1. Taxiway direction signs guide exit routes.
2. Cross the hold short line (double dashed lines first) when exiting.
3. Entire aircraft must be clear of the hold short line to be off the runway.

## Best Practices for Runway Safety:

1. Study the airport diagram before taxiing:
    1. Familiarize yourself with taxiways and runways.
2. Use GPS-enabled apps for enhanced situational awareness.
3. Verify runway alignment before takeoff:
    1. Check runway signs and surface numbers.
    2. Confirm heading indicator matches runway heading.
    3. Set heading bug to assigned runway.
4. Always communicate effectively with ATC.
5. When in doubt, ask ATC for clarification.

## Summary of Signs and Markings:

1. Yellow Lines: Taxiway markings.
2. White Lines: Runway markings.
3. Solid and Dashed Lines: Hold short positions.
    1. Solid lines on taxiway side indicate clearance required.
4. Red Signs: Mandatory instruction signs (e.g., runway hold short).
5. Black Signs with Yellow Lettering: Location signs (you are here).
6. Yellow Signs with Black Lettering: Direction signs.

Understanding and adhering to airport signs and markings are crucial for safe flying. Always stay vigilant, communicate clearly, and never hesitate to seek assistance if unsure.

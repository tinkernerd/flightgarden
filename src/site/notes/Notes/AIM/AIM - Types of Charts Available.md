1.  **VFR Navigation Charts.**
    1.  **Sectional Aeronautical Charts.** Sectional Charts are designed for visual navigation of slow to medium speed aircraft. The topographic information consists of contour lines, shaded relief, drainage patterns, and an extensive selection of visual checkpoints and landmarks used for flight under VFR. Cultural features include cities and towns, roads, railroads, and other distinct landmarks. The aeronautical information includes visual and radio aids to navigation, airports, controlled airspace, special-use airspace, obstructions, and related data. Scale 1 inch = 6.86 nm/1:500,000. 60 x 20 inches folded to 5 x 10 inches. Revised biannually, except most Alaskan charts are revised annually. (See FIG 9-1-1 and FIG 9-1-2.)
    2.  **VFR Terminal Area Charts (TAC).** TACs depict the airspace designated as Class B airspace. While similar to sectional charts, TACs have more detail because the scale is larger. The TAC should be used by pilots intending to operate to or from airfields within or near Class B or Class C airspace. Areas with TAC coverage are indicated by a • on the Sectional Chart indexes. Scale 1 inch = 3.43 nm/1:250,000. Charts are revised biannually, except Puerto Rico-Virgin Islands which is revised annually. (See FIG 9-1-1 and FIG 9-1-2.)
    3.  **U.S. Gulf Coast VFR Aeronautical Chart.** The Gulf Coast Chart is designed primarily for helicopter operation in the Gulf of Mexico area. Information depicted includes offshore mineral leasing areas and blocks, oil drilling platforms, and high density helicopter activity areas. Scale 1 inch = 13.7 nm/1:1,000,000. 55 x 27 inches folded to 5 x 10 inches. Revised annually.
    4.  **Grand Canyon VFR Aeronautical Chart.** Covers the Grand Canyon National Park area and is designed to promote aviation safety, flight free zones, and facilitate VFR navigation in this popular area. The chart contains aeronautical information for general aviation VFR pilots on one side and commercial VFR air tour operators on the other side. Revised biannually. <em>

# Solo
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section provides essential information for student pilots preparing for their first solo flight, including pre-solo requirements, flight limitations, and the responsibilities that come with solo flying.

## Pre-Solo Requirements:

1. Complete a written examination:
    1. Administered, graded, and reviewed by your instructor.
    2. Covers applicable regulations, airspace rules, procedures for the solo airport, and aircraft characteristics and limitations.
2. Understand right-of-way and minimum altitude rules.
3. Know the limitations of your student pilot certificate.

## Solo Flight Requirements:

1. Ensure you have all required documents:
    1. Logbook with instructor's endorsement.
    2. Photo ID.
    3. Student pilot certificate.
    4. Medical certificate.
2. Logbook endorsements:
    1. Endorsement is valid for 90 days.
    2. You must have received flight instruction in the specific make and model within the preceding 90 days.
    3. Endorsement is specific to make and model of aircraft.
    4. To solo a different make or model:
        1. Receive additional flight instruction.
        2. Complete another pre-solo written examination.
3. Adhere to instructor-imposed limitations:
    1. Do not fly solo if conditions exceed limitations (e.g., wind speed, ceiling, visibility) set by your instructor.

## Student Pilot Limitations:

1. You may not:
    1. Carry passengers.
    2. Fly an aircraft carrying property for compensation or hire.
    3. Act as pilot-in-command on an international flight (except specific instances in Alaska).
    4. Be a pilot flight crew member of an aircraft requiring two pilots.
    5. Fly for compensation or hire or in furtherance of a business.

## Solo Flight Limitations:

1. Visibility requirements:
    1. At least 3 statute miles during daylight hours.
    2. At least 5 statute miles at night.
2. Flight conditions:
    1. Must maintain visual reference to the surface.
    2. Cannot fly beyond a 25 nautical mile radius without a specific endorsement.
    3. All solo landings must be made at the takeoff airport unless endorsed for cross-country flight.
    4. With instructor authorization, you may make takeoffs and landings at an airport within 25 nautical miles of your training airport under certain circumstances.

## Increased Responsibilities:

1. Accountability:
    1. You are responsible for complying with federal aviation regulations.
    2. Your safety and the safety of others are now your responsibility.
2. Transition from dual instruction:
    1. Previously, your instructor ensured compliance and safety.
    2. Now, these responsibilities are transferred to you during solo flights.

## The Solo Experience:

1. Overcoming the learning plateau:
    1. It's normal to experience a slump after initial training.
    2. Progress improves as takeoffs, landings, and airmanship develop.
2. First solo flight:
    1. Your instructor may inform you after a session to make solo takeoffs and landings.
    2. Traditionally, students perform three takeoffs and landings.
    3. The aircraft may feel different without the instructor (e.g., climbs faster, descends slower).
    4. The cabin will be noticeably quieter.
3. Emotional aspects:
    1. Solo flight is a major milestone and an exciting experience.
    2. You'll feel a great sense of achievement and freedom.

## Moving Forward:

1. Next steps:
    1. If pursuing a sport or recreational certificate, you're close to completion.
    2. If aiming for a private pilot certificate, you'll soon begin cross-country flights.
2. Becoming pilot-in-command:
    1. The novelty of solo flight will fade as you take on full PIC responsibilities.
    2. You are responsible for assessing the success of each solo lesson and reporting progress to your instructor.
    3. The joy and memories of your solo flight will last a lifetime.

Congratulations on reaching this significant milestone in your flight training. Fly safe and enjoy the journey ahead!

# Special Use Airspace
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers Special Use Airspace (SUA), its various types, and other relevant airspace areas, providing essential knowledge for new student pilots.

## Special Use Airspace:

1. Types of Special Use Airspace:
    1. Prohibited Areas:
        1. Flight is strictly prohibited.
        2. Example: P-40 protects Camp David in Maryland.
    2. Restricted Areas:
        1. Flight is subject to restrictions.
        2. Example: R-6612 active to 7000 feet Monday-Friday, 0800-1700 local time.
        3. Pilots should check NOTAMs for activation status.
    3. Warning Areas:
        1. Located in international airspace.
        2. Hazardous activities to non-participating aircraft.
        3. Cannot be designated restricted because they're over international waters.
    4. Military Operation Areas (MOAs):
        1. Used to separate military training from IFR traffic.
        2. VFR flight permitted but exercise extreme caution.
        3. Check with ATC for MOA activity status.
    5. Alert Areas:
        1. High volume of pilot training or unusual aerial activity.
        2. Both participating and transiting pilots are responsible for collision avoidance.
    6. Controlled Firing Areas:
        1. Activities suspended immediately when an aircraft approaches.
        2. Not charted due to immediate suspension of activities.
2. Checking NOTAMs:
    1. Essential for changes in airspace dimensions or activation times.
    2. Example: P-40 expands when the President is present.

## Other Airspace Areas:

1. Military Training Routes (MTRs):
    1. Developed for military flights above 250 knots below 10,000 feet MSL.
    2. Identified as VR (VFR) or IR (IFR).
        1. Three-digit numbers: segments above 1500 feet AGL.
        2. Four-digit numbers: entirely below 1500 feet AGL.
    3. Pilots should be vigilant when near MTRs.
    4. Check status by contacting Flight Service.
2. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs):
    1. Protect persons or property, disaster relief, or VIP movements.
    2. Examples include Presidential TFRs and major sporting events.
    3. Check NOTAMs before flight for current TFRs.
    4. Violations can result in interception or use of deadly force.
3. Parachute Jump Areas:
    1. Listed in the Chart Supplement.
    2. Jump aircraft pilots should communicate intentions on advisory frequencies.
    3. Pilots should exercise extreme caution in these areas.
4. Published VFR Routes:
    4. Assist pilots flying near or through complex Class B airspace.
    5. Types include:
        1. VFR Flyways:
            1. Planning routes avoiding Class B airspace.
            2. Compliance is voluntary.
        2. VFR Corridors:
            1. Tunnels through Class B airspace.
            2. No ATC clearance required but follow specific boundaries.
        3. Class B Transition Routes:
            1. Require ATC clearance.
            2. Depicted on Terminal Area Charts with assigned altitudes.
5. Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSAs):
    1. Depicted with grey rings on charts.
    2. Provide radar traffic advisory service near terminals.
    3. Participation is voluntary but recommended.
    4. Class D airspace rules apply within the core area.
6. National Security Areas (NSAs):
    1. Areas requiring increased security on the ground.
    2. Pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid these areas.
    3. Avoid flying over sensitive locations like power plants and military facilities.

## Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ):

1. Definition:
    1. Airspace where identification, location, and control of aircraft are required in the interest of national security.
2. Requirements for operating in an ADIZ:
    1. File an IFR or Defense VFR (DVFR) flight plan before takeoff.
    2. Two-way radio communication and transponder with altitude reporting required.
    3. Make position reports to the appropriate agency.
    4. If unable to comply, do not enter the ADIZ.
    5. Non-compliance can result in interception by military aircraft.
3. Depiction:
    1. Shown on sectional charts as a magenta line with rows of double dots.
    2. Exists along coastlines and borders.

## Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA):

1. Extends from the surface up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL.
2. Requirements for operating within the SFRA:
    1. File and activate a DC SFRA flight plan.
    2. Maintain two-way radio communication with ATC.
    3. Obtain and squawk a transponder code.
3. Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ):
    1. Covers the central core of the SFRA.
    2. More stringent requirements; unauthorized entry is prohibited.
    3. Violation may result in interception and use of deadly force.
4. National Capital Region Visual Warning System:
    1. Uses red and green laser lights to warn pilots of violations.
    2. If observed, pilots should contact ATC immediately and exit the area.
5. Special Awareness Training:
    1. Required for pilots operating within 60 NM of the DCA VOR/DME.
    2. Complete the training at [www.faasafety.gov](http://www.faasafety.gov/) and carry the certificate of completion.

## Key Takeaways:

1. Always check current charts and NOTAMs before flight.
2. Understand and comply with airspace requirements to ensure safety.
3. Maintain communication with ATC when required.
4. Exercise vigilance and good judgment when operating near special use or restricted airspace.

Remember, being knowledgeable about airspace classifications and regulations is crucial for safe and efficient flying.

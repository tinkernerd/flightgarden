# Flight Planning Part 2: Preparing a Navlog
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers how to prepare a navigation log (navlog) for a cross-country flight, focusing on determining time en route, groundspeed, fuel requirements, and selecting visual checkpoints for effective pilotage and dead reckoning navigation.

## Plotting the Course and Selecting Checkpoints:

1. Focus on the initial leg from Clermont County Airport to Fayette County:
    1. Plot the course on the sectional chart.
    2. Select visual checkpoints along the route.
    3. Enter calculations on the navlog for in-flight navigation.
2. Select visual checkpoints using the sectional chart:
    1. First checkpoint: Town of Owensville (5 NM from departure).
        1. Close to the top of climb to cruise altitude (3,500 feet).
        2. Helps ensure correct initial direction.
    2. Second checkpoint: Town of Midland (15 NM from Owensville).
        1. Features a road and a railroad.
    3. Third checkpoint: Airborne Airpark (Wilmington) on the left.
        1. 29 NM from Clermont County Airport.
        2. Approximately 18 NM remaining to destination.
    4. Fourth checkpoint: Town of Sabina on the left.
    5. Fifth checkpoint: Town of Washington Courthouse ahead.
        1. Airport is just north of the town.
        2. Features a railroad track, road, and obstruction nearby.
3. Note nearby airports along the route:
    1. Useful for potential diversions if necessary.

## Entering Checkpoints and Calculations on Navlog:

1. List the names of each checkpoint on the navlog.
2. Calculate for each leg between checkpoints:
    1. Compass heading (adjusted for wind, variation, deviation).
    2. Distance.
    3. Groundspeed.
    4. Time en route.
    5. Estimated fuel burn.
3. Determine true airspeed using the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).
4. Compute time, fuel, and distance to climb to cruise altitude.
5. Enter forecast winds aloft at planned cruise altitude.

## Calculating Flight Details Using an E6B:

1. Use the E6B flight computer to calculate for each leg:
    1. Wind correction angle.
    2. True heading.
    3. Groundspeed.
2. Adjust heading for magnetic variation and compass deviation:
    1. True heading + Variation + Deviation = Compass heading.
3. Use a plotter to measure distances between checkpoints.
4. Calculate leg times and fuel requirements:
    1. Use leg distance and groundspeed to determine time en route.
    2. Calculate fuel burn based on time and fuel consumption rate.
5. Fill in the navlog with calculated values for each leg.

## Summing Totals and Fuel Planning:

1. Sum the total distance, time, and fuel for the leg.
2. Repeat calculations for the remaining legs of the trip.
3. Calculate total fuel required for the round trip:
    1. Include fuel for all legs plus reserve fuel.
4. Consider FAA fuel reserve requirements:
    1. For day VFR: enough fuel to fly to first intended landing plus 30 minutes at normal cruise.
    2. Plan to carry more than the minimum reserve for safety (e.g., 45 or 60 minutes).
5. Ensure total fuel required does not exceed aircraft's usable fuel capacity.

## Key Takeaways:

1. Cross-country flights are a series of short legs connected together.
2. Accurate planning involves careful calculation of headings, times, and fuel.
3. Regularly checking and updating navlog enhances in-flight navigation via pilotage and dead reckoning.
4. Always be prepared for potential diversions by noting nearby airports.
5. Prioritize safety by planning adequate fuel reserves beyond the minimum requirements.

By following these steps, you can effectively prepare a navlog for your cross-country flight, ensuring accurate navigation and adherence to safety regulations.

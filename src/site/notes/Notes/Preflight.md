# Preflight
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers the essential steps and considerations for conducting a thorough preflight inspection to ensure aircraft safety before takeoff.

## Introduction to Preflight Inspection:

- Importance of preflight inspection:
    - Ensures all systems are functioning properly.
    - Confirms sufficient fuel and oil for the intended flight.
    - Allows you to check the airplane inside and out before flying.
- General approach:
    - Begin observing the airplane as you approach it.
    - Look for fuel or oil leaks, underinflated tires, and any obstructions.
- Use of checklists:
    - Recommended to use a written checklist during preflight.
    - Ensures all inspections are completed consistently each time.
    - Checklists can be found in the Pilot's Operating Handbook or as separate documents.
- General rules during inspection:
    - Look for anything that appears different or out of the ordinary.
    - Be gentle with control surfaces and antennas to avoid damage.

## Interior Inspection:

- Check required documents are on board:
    - Airworthiness certificate (must be displayed).
    - Registration.
    - Operating handbook.
    - Weight and balance information.
- Remove control lock and perform electrical checks:
    - Turn master switch ON.
    - Check fuel quantity gauges and note amounts for later verification.
    - Ensure low fuel annunciator lights are OFF.
    - Turn avionics master switch ON, listen for cooling fan.
    - Test annunciator panel; all lights should illuminate.
- Check flight controls and systems:
    - Lower flaps fully to aid in exterior inspection.
    - Turn on exterior lights briefly to check operation, then turn OFF to conserve battery.
    - Ensure fuel selector valve is on BOTH and fuel shutoff valve is ON.
    - Verify seat stop bolts are secure.

## Exterior Inspection:

- Left side of fuselage:
    - Inspect general condition while moving towards the tail.
    - Examine horizontal stabilizer and elevator for dents, cracks, and security.
    - Check elevator trim tab and push rod underneath.
- Tail section:
    - Inspect vertical stabilizer and rudder for damage and security.
    - Remove tail tie-down and check underneath for damage.
- Right side of fuselage and right wing:
    - Inspect along the flaps and ailerons; ensure freedom of movement.
    - Check wingtip, navigation, and strobe lights for damage.
    - Examine leading edge for dents or wrinkled skin.
- Fuel system checks on right wing:
    - Drain fuel from each of the 5 fuel sumps under the wing.
    - Check samples for proper color and absence of water or contaminants.
    - Visually check fuel quantity by opening fuel cap on top of wing.
    - Ensure fuel cap vent is clear and cap is securely replaced.
- Right main landing gear:
    - Inspect tire for proper inflation and good condition.
    - Check for leaks from brake lines and secure bolts.
- Nose section:
    - Drain fuel from the 3 sumps underneath, checking for contaminants.
    - Check oil level; should be six or more quarts for a training flight.
    - Inspect engine compartment for bird or insect nests.
    - Examine air inlets, alternator belt tension, and induction air filter.
    - Inspect spinner and propeller for damage; check propeller blades for nicks or dents.
    - Inspect nose wheel for proper inflation and condition; check nose gear strut for proper extension.
- Left wing and side of fuselage:
    - Ensure static port is clear of obstructions.
    - Repeat inspection steps similar to right wing.
    - Check additional components:
        - Fuel vent tube.
        - Pitot tube.
        - Stall warning indicator.

By completing a thorough preflight inspection, you ensure that the aircraft is safe and ready for flight, reducing the risk of in-flight issues and enhancing overall safety.

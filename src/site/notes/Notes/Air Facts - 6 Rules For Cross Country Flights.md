# Air Facts - 6 Rules For Cross Country Flights
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

Getting out of the traffic pattern and going on a real trip is a lot of fun. It may even be the reason you’re learning to fly in the first place. But the same reasons these trips are so much fun—new places to see, a goal at the end of the flight—can lead to challenges if you aren’t prepared.

Here are six rules to keep in mind when you’re flying VFR cross countries. They may not be formal regulations, but they’re good habits that can keep you safe and comfortable on that big trip.

## Lesson One: Wait for a Sure Thing

1. When it comes to weather, don't take off until there's a very good chance of success.
2. Avoid the temptation to depart as soon as the weather report shows VFR, especially if you're behind schedule.
3. Be patient and wait until the weather trend is clearly in your favor.
4. Be honest with yourself—you may not turn around if you encounter marginal conditions after takeoff.

## Lesson Two: Know the Air Mass

1. Determine whether you're flying in a stable or unstable air mass.
2. Unstable air masses, especially in summer, can lead to widespread thunderstorms as the day heats up.
3. Stable air masses may cause hazy skies but are usually free of convection.
4. When in doubt, remember: in summer, it's best to finish flying by noon.

## Lesson Three: Always Have an Out

1. Always have a backup plan in case you can't reach your destination.
2. This applies to both weather and fuel planning.
3. Ensure alternate airports have the necessary services, like fuel, and verify that they will be available when you arrive.
4. A little homework ahead of time can really pay off.

## Lesson Four: Slow Down

1. If something goes wrong, force yourself to slow down and double-check your last few steps.
2. Creating a mental circuit breaker can prevent critical mistakes caused by rushing.
3. Accidents have happened because pilots rushed and made errors when out of rhythm.

## Lesson Five: Understand the Terrain

1. Consider the effects of terrain on your flight, especially when crossing mountains or flying over foothills.
2. Plan a safe altitude above terrain—not just to avoid collisions but also to account for weather interactions.
3. Terrain and weather interact in various ways; what's true in the plains may not hold in the hills.
4. Be cautious about extrapolating weather conditions between distant airports with different terrains.

## Lesson Six: Use Technology Wisely

1. Take advantage of modern technology to make cross-country flying easier and safer.
2. Examples include using multi-function displays to see terrain and weather, and utilizing accurate winds aloft forecasts from your phone.
3. Be proficient with the technology to prevent it from becoming a distraction.
4. Ensure that gadgets are tools, not crutches; maintain your basic stick and rudder skills and be prepared to navigate using pilotage if necessary.

Whether you’re flying 1,000 miles to attend a big airshow or just heading to the lake for a family vacation, cross-country flying should be near the top of your aviation to-do list. With a little preparation and some good discipline, it can be a fun and efficient way to get around.

# Air Facts: Eye to the Sky
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section emphasizes the importance of collision avoidance and active scanning for other aircraft, highlighting the responsibilities of a student pilot in maintaining situational awareness for safe flying.

## Collision Avoidance:

1. Learn about collision avoidance early in your training:
    1. Actively scan for other aircraft; they are present and can be spotted if you look attentively.
2. Take responsibility as a student pilot:
    1. Do not rely solely on your instructor to scan for other airplanes.
    2. Develop good scanning habits from the beginning of your training.
3. Develop second nature scanning habits:
    1. Just like looking both ways before crossing a street.
    2. Your eyes should be outside, using the horizon as the primary reference for pitch and bank.
4. Performing maneuvers:
    1. Always conduct clearing turns before maneuvers like stalls or slow flight.
    2. Make scanning the airspace a ritual each time.
5. Handling potential traffic conflicts:
    1. Don't focus solely on right-of-way rules to the point of inaction.
    2. Take action that maximizes space between you and the other aircraft.
    3. Address any right-of-way debates after ensuring safety.
6. Enhancing your visibility:
    1. Use as many lights as possible, even during daytime.
    2. Increase the chances of other pilots seeing you.

## Technology in Collision Avoidance:

1. Role of technology:
    1. The NextGen air traffic control system includes a traffic component providing aircraft locations via electronic datalink.
2. Equipment required:
    1. An ADS-B Out transponder.
    2. An ADS-B In receiver and display.
3. Implementing technology:
    1. The ADS-B In receiver can be a simple portable device paired with an iPad.
4. Using technology wisely:
    1. Avoid increased heads-down time by not fixating on screens.
    2. Utilize audio alerts to stay aware of nearby aircraft.

Remember, active visual scanning combined with the effective use of technology enhances collision avoidance, contributing to safer skies for everyone.

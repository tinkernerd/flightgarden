# Night Flying
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section introduces the fundamentals of night flying, highlighting the differences from daytime flight and providing essential tips for new student pilots.

## Introduction to Night Flying:

1. Night flying offers a unique and enjoyable experience:
    1. Air is usually calm and smooth.
    2. Different visual environment compared to daylight flying.
2. Training requirements for private pilots include:
    1. At least three hours of night dual instruction.
    2. A cross-country flight over 100 nautical miles.
    3. 10 takeoffs and 10 full-stop landings at night.
3. Importance of night flying proficiency:
    1. Prepares pilots for unintended flights extending into darkness.
    2. Enhances overall pilot skills and confidence.

## Understanding Night Vision:

1. Differences in vision at night:
    1. Visual acuity is restricted compared to daytime.
    2. Dim objects are best seen slightly off-center due to rod and cone function in the retina.
2. Dark adaptation techniques:
    1. Avoid bright white light before flying to adjust eyes to darkness.
    2. Full dark adaptation can take up to 30 minutes.
3. Maintaining night vision:
    1. Adjust cockpit and instrument lights to comfortable levels.
    2. Use red or dim lighting to preserve night vision.
4. Limitations of night vision:
    1. Eyes never function as effectively at night.
    2. Proper techniques greatly improve night vision capabilities.

## Preflight Considerations:

1. Ensure all aircraft lighting systems are operational:
    1. Position or navigation lights (red on left wingtip, green on right wingtip, white on tail).
    2. Anti-collision lights and landing lights.
    3. Instrument panel lights.
2. Check the electrical system:
    1. If equipped with fuses, carry a spare set as required by regulations.
3. Carry a reliable flashlight:
    1. Serves as a backup in case of electrical failure.
    2. Keep it accessible to avoid searching in the dark.
    3. Consider a small flashlight that can be carried in a shirt pocket or around the neck.

## Airport Lighting:

1. Understanding airport lighting systems:
    1. Taxiways are marked with blue lights.
    2. Airport beacon flashes alternately white and green for civilian airports.
    3. Military airport beacons flash two quick white lights between green flashes.
2. Identifying runway lighting:
    1. Runway threshold (end) marked with green lights.
    2. Some thresholds have green on approach side and red on runway side.
    3. Runway edge lights are white.
    4. Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) use pulsating white strobe lights.
3. Obstruction lighting:
    1. Red lights mark buildings and obstructions in the airport area.

## Night Takeoff and Climb:

1. Before taxiing for takeoff:
    1. Turn off landing lights in run-up area to conserve energy and preserve others' night vision.
    2. Conduct a thorough run-up using the checklist.
    3. Ensure the generator or alternator is functioning properly.
2. Taxiing to the runway:
    1. Turn on landing and anti-collision lights.
    2. Obtain tower clearance or check for traffic at non-towered airports.
    3. Taxi slowly and cautiously due to reduced visibility.
3. Takeoff procedures:
    1. Align heading indicator with runway heading.
    2. Apply power smoothly; use runway and landing lights to maintain direction.
    3. Expect the sensation of higher speed due to lack of visual cues.
    4. Rotate at normal liftoff speed and climb at appropriate airspeed.
    5. Monitor instruments closely during climb (heading, attitude, vertical speed).

## Night Navigation:

1. Maintaining situational awareness:
    1. Use radio navigation aids backed up with dead reckoning.
    2. Seek assistance from ATC if unsure of position.
    3. Visual landmarks may not be visible over dark areas.
2. Radio-controlled runway lighting:
    1. Activate lights by keying the microphone on the appropriate frequency.
    2. Click microphone 7 times within 5 seconds for maximum intensity.
    3. Adjust intensity with additional clicks if available.
    4. Lights remain on for 15 minutes from last activation.

## Recognizing Other Aircraft at Night:

1. Understanding aircraft navigation lights:
    1. Red light indicates left wingtip; aircraft is passing right to left.
    2. Green light indicates right wingtip; aircraft is passing left to right.
    3. White light indicates tail of the aircraft.
    4. Both red and green lights indicate a head-on approach.
2. Right-of-way rules at night:
    1. If you see a green light, you have the right-of-way.
    2. If you see a red light, yield to the other aircraft.
3. Usage of navigation lights:
    1. Must be turned on from sunset to sunrise when taxiing or flying.
    2. Aircraft parked or moved in night flight operations areas must be illuminated or properly marked.

## Night Landing Procedures:

1. Approach considerations:
    1. Identify the runway threshold and keep it in sight during pattern entry.
    2. Complete the pre-landing checklist.
    3. Verify runway heading matches heading indicator on final approach.
2. Challenges of night landings:
    1. Difficulty in judging height and speed above the ground.
    2. Use normal approach airspeeds to avoid being low and slow or high and fast.
3. Visual cues during approach:
    1. A low approach makes the runway appear shorter and narrower.
    2. A high approach makes the runway appear wider and closer.
    3. A proper approach shows the runway in correct perspective.
4. Using landing lights:
    1. Aid in determining when to begin the flare for touchdown.
    2. Do not focus solely on the illuminated area; use runway edge lights as well.
5. Landing without landing lights:
    1. Begin the roundout when runway lights at the far end appear to rise.
    2. Rely on visual cues from runway lighting to judge height.
6. After landing:
    1. Use caution due to limited visibility.
    2. Taxi slowly to parking area.

## Visual Glide Slope Indicators:

1. Importance of visual glide slope indicators (VGSI):
    1. Assist pilots during landing approaches.
    2. Provide visual descent information to the runway.
2. Types of VGSI systems:
    1. Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI).
    2. Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).
    3. Tri-color Visual Glide Slope Indicator.
3. Using the VASI system:
    1. Consists of two bars (near and far) showing red or white lights.
    2. On proper glide path: see red over white ("red over white, you're all right").
    3. Below glide path: both bars appear red.
    4. Above glide path: both bars appear white.
4. Understanding the PAPI system:
    1. Uses a single row of lights (usually four).
    2. More white lights indicate higher than glide path.
    3. More red lights indicate lower than glide path.
    4. All red lights signify dangerously low altitude ("all red, you might be dead").
5. Tri-color VGSI system:
    1. Single light unit showing three colors.
    2. Green indicates on glide path.
    3. Red indicates below glide path.
    4. Amber indicates above glide path.
    5. Transition between colors may appear dark or dim.
6. Best practices when using VGSI:
    1. Align visually with runway before starting descent.
    2. Use runway lights for proper course guidance.
    3. VGSI provides safe obstruction clearance within specific parameters.

## Night Flight Illusions:

1. Common illusions affecting landing approaches:
    1. Narrow or wide runways affecting perception of altitude.
    2. Up-sloping or down-sloping runways altering glide path perception.
    3. Atmospheric conditions like rain, haze, or snow misleading distance judgment.
2. Additional night illusions:
    1. Dark areas making the aircraft seem higher than it is.
    2. Straight lights (e.g., roads) mistaken for runway lights.
    3. Bright runway lights causing illusion of less distance to runway.
    4. Dim runway lights causing pilot to fly lower approach due to perceived increased distance.
3. Avoiding landing errors:
    1. Be aware of potential illusions and anticipate them.
    2. Use visual glide slope indicators when available.
    3. Avoid excessive airspeed on approach and landing.
    4. Execute approaches and landings as during daytime operations.

Remember, night flying offers a unique and rewarding experience when approached with the proper knowledge and techniques. By understanding the differences from daytime flight and practicing these safe flying practices, you will enhance your skills and confidence as a pilot.

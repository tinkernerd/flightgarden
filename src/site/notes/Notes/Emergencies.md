# Emergencies
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers essential emergency procedures for pilots, including how to handle engine failures, forced landings, instrument failures, and emergency descents. Understanding these procedures is crucial for ensuring safety during unexpected situations.

## Regulations in Emergencies

1. In an emergency, you may deviate from any rule as necessary to meet the situation.
2. The FAA may request a written report about any rule deviation:
    1. If they don't ask, no report is required.

## Aborting Takeoffs

1. If the engine doesn't sound right or the airplane feels strange during takeoff roll:
    1. Reduce power immediately.
    2. Abort the takeoff.
    3. Taxi back and have the airplane checked to your satisfaction.

## Engine Failure After Takeoff

1. Do not attempt to turn back to the runway:
    1. Statistics show you probably won't make it.
    2. Chances of making a 180-degree turn with a dead engine at low altitude are not good.
2. Instead:
    1. Lower the nose quickly to maintain flying speed.
    2. Fly straight ahead and make the best landing possible.
    3. If under 200 feet, keep turns shallow and to a minimum.

## Partial Power Failure on Takeoff

1. Fly straight ahead and try to gain altitude.
2. Keep turns shallow.
3. Gradually turn back to the airport.
4. Keep power on until you are sure you can land normally.

## Forced Landings Away from Airport

1. Your first concern is to fly the airplane:
    1. Establish the best glide speed.
2. Select a suitable landing field:
    2. Know the wind direction.
    3. Choose the largest and best field available.
3. Above 1,000 feet:
    1. Trim for best glide speed.
    2. Spiral down over your chosen field.
    3. Set up a normal traffic pattern approach.
4. Below 1,000 feet:
    4. Trim for best glide speed.
    5. Select a field for a normal approach if possible.
5. Perform the emergency procedures checklist for your airplane.

## Emergency Procedures Checklist (Skyhawk Example)

1. Establish best glide speed of 65 knots.
2. Ensure fuel shutoff valve is ON.
3. Set fuel selector valve to BOTH.
4. Turn auxiliary fuel pump ON.
5. Set mixture to RICH if restart hasn't occurred.
6. Ignition switch to BOTH or START if propeller is stopped.
7. If power isn't restored, prepare for a power-off landing:
    1. Seat backs upright; seats and seat belts secured.
    2. Mixture idle cut-off.
    3. Fuel shutoff valve OFF.
    4. Ignition switch OFF.
    5. Flaps as required (full flaps recommended).
    6. Airspeed 60 knots with flaps down.
    7. Master switch OFF when landing is assured.
    8. Unlatch doors prior to touchdown.

## Approach and Landing

1. Once you select a field, stick with it.
2. Avoid last-minute changes when low and slow.
3. Approach as you would at your home airport traffic pattern.
4. If too high:
    1. Adjust your turn to final to avoid overshooting.
    2. Use flaps and slips carefully.
5. Don't try to stretch the glide:
    1. Pushing the nose up increases drag and steepens descent.
6. Discontinue simulated forced landings when you're sure you can make the field.
7. Forced landings are typically not practiced solo.

## Instrument Failures

1. Your instructor may cover instruments to simulate failure.
2. You can land without an airspeed indicator by using proper pitch and power.
3. You can judge height without an altimeter when necessary.

## Emergency Descents

1. May be required due to:
    1. In-flight fire.
    2. Loss of cabin pressure.
    3. Medical emergencies.
2. Provides maximum rate of descent while staying within structural limits.
3. General procedure:
    1. Power to idle.
    2. Propellers full forward (if applicable).
    3. Landing gear extended.
    4. Flaps retracted.
    5. Descend at specified emergency airspeed (don't exceed VNE, VLE, or VFE).
    6. If turbulent, comply with maneuvering speed (VA).
4. Conduct descent in a turn:
    1. Look for traffic below.
    2. Identify potential landing areas.
    3. A 30â€“45 degree bank provides a positive load factor.
5. Recovery:
    1. Begin recovery at a safe altitude for level flight or landing.
    2. In training, recover after descent is stabilized.
    3. Avoid prolonged practice descents to prevent engine shock cooling.

Remember, always prioritize flying the airplane. Stay calm, follow procedures, and make decisions that ensure the safety of everyone on board.

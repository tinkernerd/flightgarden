NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen) are critical pieces of information that every pilot must review before a flight. They provide real-time updates on conditions and restrictions that could affect your flight. This guide covers the types of NOTAMs and offers resources to ensure you're always up to date.

## ðŸ›¬ Key NOTAM Concepts for Pilots:

# Types of NOTAMs
- **D (Distance) NOTAMs**
	- Contain information about airports, navigation aids, services, and facilities.
	- Example: Runway closures or unserviceable taxiways.

- **FDC (Flight Data Center) NOTAMs**
	- Regulatory notices such as airspace restrictions or amendments to instrument approach procedures.
	- Example: Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs).

- **Military NOTAMs**
	- Information specific to military operations and facilities.

- **International NOTAMs**
	- Pertinent to flights outside the United States, detailing airspace restrictions, weather-related issues, or other international concerns.

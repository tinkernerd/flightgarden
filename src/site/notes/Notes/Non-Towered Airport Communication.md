# Non-Towered Airport Communication
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section covers the procedures and best practices for operating into and out of nontowered airports, including effective communication techniques and safety considerations for student pilots.

## Introduction to Nontowered Airports:
1. Nontowered airports are found in Class G or Class E airspace.
2. Radio communications are not mandatory at these airports:
    1. Proper reporting enhances safety.
    2. Be aware of pilots flying without a radio.
    3. Always maintain an active visual scan for other aircraft.
    4. Fly a standard traffic pattern even if you don't hear radio communications.
## Determining the Active Runway:
1. Check local weather to determine wind direction and runway in use.
2. Use Automated Weather Information Systems:
    1. Available systems include AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS.
    2. Find frequencies in the Chart Supplement, sectional chart, or GPS.
    3. Weather updates are provided minute by minute.
    4. Broadcasts are computer-generated voices.
    5. May include NOTAMs recorded by the airport operator.
3. Listen to CTAF for other pilots' communications to determine the active runway.
## Communicating on CTAF and UNICOM:
1. CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency):
	1. Allows pilots to communicate intentions in a nontowered airport environment.
	2. Indicated on sectional charts by a circle with a "C" in the center.
	3. CTAF and UNICOM may share the same frequency.
2. Use CTAF for traffic advisories:
	1. Start with the airport's name followed by "traffic."
	2. Example: "Georgetown traffic."
3. Use UNICOM for airport information:
	1. Call with the phrase: "[Airport Name] UNICOM."
	2. Example: "Georgetown UNICOM."

## Radio Communication Procedures:

1. Avoid unnecessary communications on CTAF:
    1. CTAF is not for casual chatter.
    2. Non-essential communication may block important safety calls.
2. Do not transmit "Traffic in the area, please advise":
    1. This phrase clogs the frequency without serving the intended purpose.
    2. Listening is more effective to determine other traffic.
3. If no weather reporting or communications are available:
    1. Call UNICOM for a landing advisory.
    2. Example:
        1. Pilot: "Clermont County UNICOM, Skyhawk 121UC, ten miles east, landing advisory."
        2. UNICOM: "Skyhawk 121UC, winds are 250 at 10 knots, aircraft in the pattern using runway 22."
        3. Pilot: "Skyhawk 121UC, runway 22."
4. Making initial calls on CTAF:
    1. Announce position about ten miles out.
    2. Include: Airport name, aircraft type and call sign, intentions, and optional repetition of airport name.
    3. Example: "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 121UC, ten miles east, landing 22, Clermont traffic."
5. Entering the traffic pattern:
    1. Make an entry call on CTAF:
        1. Example: "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 1UC, four miles out, 45 to the left downwind, landing 22, Clermont traffic."
    2. Use shortened call signs if there is no confusion.
    3. Announce entry to downwind, base, and final legs.
        1. Downwind: "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 1UC, entering downwind, landing 22, Clermont traffic."
        2. Base: "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 1UC, base, 22, Clermont traffic."
        3. Final: "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 1UC, final, 22."
6. After landing:
    1. Announce when clear of the active runway.
    2. Example: "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 1UC, clear of 22."
    3. Turn off the transponder as part of after-landing checks.

## Departure Procedures:

1. Before taxiing:
    1. Listen to automated weather if available.
    2. Monitor CTAF to understand other aircraft's activities.
2. Perform a radio check if necessary:
    1. Example: "Clermont traffic, Skyhawk 121UC, radio check."
    2. Response: "I hear the radio check."
3. Transponder settings:
    1. Set to VFR squawk code 1200.
    2. Place in Standby position to warm up.
    3. Turn to Altitude mode before takeoff.
4. Announcing departure:
    1. After before-takeoff checks, scan for traffic, then announce departure.
    2. Do not use "Position and hold" or "Line up and wait" at nontowered airports.
    3. Example for remaining in pattern:
        1. "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 121UC, departing 22, closed traffic."
        2. Announce turns to crosswind and successive legs.
        3. "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 1UC, left crosswind, 22, Clermont traffic."
    4. Example for departing the area:
        1. "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 121UC, departing 22, Southeast departure."
        2. After takeoff: "Clermont County traffic, Skyhawk 1UC, departing Southeast."
5. Use standard traffic pattern departures:
    1. Straight-out departure.
    2. 45-degree turn in the direction of the pattern.
6. Include your ultimate direction of flight in departure call.

## Importance of Correct Communication:

1. Correct communication enhances safety.
2. Adhering to proper protocol shows professionalism.
3. Sets a good example for other pilots.

Remember, effective communication and adherence to standard procedures are crucial for safe operations at nontowered airports. Always maintain vigilance and be proactive in your communications to ensure safety for yourself and others.

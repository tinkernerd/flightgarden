## Staying Calm During Emergencies:

    2. Recognize that panic has no place in the airplane.

## Handling Critical Situations:

    2. Accomplish those items without delay.
2. After completing memory items:
    1. Assess the situation further.
    2. Focus on flying the airplane.
    3. Grab the emergency checklist and complete every item to help remedy the situation.

## Importance of Preparedness:

## Suspicion and Decisive Action:

    2. Be ready to take decisive action when needed.
2. Most emergencies are preceded by warnings:
    1. At the first hint of a problem, swing into action.
    2. Head the airplane toward a suitable landing place.
    3. This proactive approach may prevent the real emergency from occurring.

## Professionalism in Emergency Response:

2. Any pilot can act professionally:

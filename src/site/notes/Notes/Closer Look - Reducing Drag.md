# Closer Look: Reducing Drag
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section explores how modern aircraft reduce drag through aerodynamic design features to achieve higher performance and speed.

## Introduction to Drag Reduction

1. High-performance airplanes require more than powerful engines:
    1. Aerodynamic cleanliness is crucial to minimize drag.
    2. Sleek exteriors contribute to top-end speed.

## Cessna Citation Ten's Drag Reduction Features

1. Notable characteristics of the Citation Ten:
    1. Sleek lines and streamlined design enhance speed.
    2. Laminar flow swept wings provide high-speed performance at high altitudes.
    3. Winglets minimize induced drag by reducing wingtip vortices.
    4. Swept-back forward-facing surfaces, like the windshield, reduce aerodynamic resistance.
    5. Smooth exterior surfaces without raised screws or rivets reduce skin-friction drag.

## Cirrus Aircraft's Drag Reduction Features

1. Cirrus aircraft are known for aerodynamic efficiency:
    1. Advanced composite construction reduces overall weight and allows for smoother surfaces.
    2. Thin laminar flow wings decrease skin-friction drag.
    3. Winglets at the tips reduce induced drag from wingtip vortices.
    4. Gap seals around ailerons further reduce form drag on the wings.
    5. Sleek front design includes:
        1. Curved cowl designed around the engine and air inlets.
        2. Plexiglass cover over the landing light for smooth airflow.
        3. Swept-back windshield to reduce drag.
    6. Teardrop-shaped wheel fairings reduce form drag caused by fixed landing gear.

## Observing Drag Reduction in Other Aircraft

1. Encouragement to explore:
    1. Look around the airport for various makes and models.
    2. Identify drag-reducing features on different aircraft.

Understanding and recognizing aerodynamic features that reduce drag can enhance pilot knowledge and appreciation for aircraft design.

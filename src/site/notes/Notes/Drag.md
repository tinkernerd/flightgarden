# Drag
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers the concept of drag in aerodynamics and its importance for pilots to understand how it affects flight performance.

## Introduction to Aerodynamics:

1. Aerodynamics deals with forces exerted by air in motion.
2. Understanding airflow around the airplane is crucial.

## Drag and Its Components:

1. Drag acts parallel to the relative wind and rearward.
    1. Produced by moving the airplane through the air.
2. Two components of drag:
    1. Induced Drag:
        1. Caused by generating lift.
        2. A byproduct of lift; increases with angle of attack.
    2. Parasite Drag:
        1. The price paid to move the airplane through the air.
        2. Includes form drag, skin friction drag, and interference drag.

## Parasite Drag:

1. Form Drag:
    1. Caused by the shape of the aircraft parts.
    2. Increases with the square of speed.
    3. Streamlining reduces form drag.
2. Skin Friction Drag:
    1. Due to the roughness of surfaces.
    2. Reduced by smooth surfaces, flush riveting, and waxing.
3. Interference Drag:
    1. Occurs where different parts of the airplane meet (e.g., wings and fuselage).
    2. Creates turbulent airflow increasing total drag.
    3. Reduced by using fillets and fairings for smoother airflow.

## Induced Drag:

1. Results from wingtip vortices and downwash.
    1. Lift vector is tilted rearward due to downwash.
    2. Increases as the angle of attack increases.
2. Reducing Induced Drag:
    1. Using wingtip devices like tip tanks, spill plates, and winglets.
    2. Increasing wing aspect ratio (longer wingspan).
3. Aspect Ratio:
    1. Ratio of wing length to chord (width).
    2. High aspect ratio wings (e.g., sailplanes) have less induced drag.
    3. Low aspect ratio wings (e.g., fighter jets) have more induced drag at low speeds.

## Effects of Drag on Flight:

1. Affects speed, fuel consumption, landing distance, and takeoff performance.
2. Pilot's influence on drag:
    1. Using flaps alters drag for landing and takeoff.
    2. Performing maneuvers like forward slips increases drag intentionally.
3. Understanding drag helps in utilizing it to your advantage.

Remember, managing drag is essential for efficient and safe flying. As you continue to learn, you'll apply these principles to improve your piloting skills.

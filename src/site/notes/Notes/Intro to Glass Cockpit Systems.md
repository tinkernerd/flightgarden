# Intro to Glass Cockpit Systems
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section introduces the Garmin G1000 Glass Cockpit System, providing foundational knowledge for new student pilots to understand and operate modern avionics.

## The G1000 Glass Cockpit System:

1. **Dual LCD Displays:**
    1. **Primary Flight Display (PFD):** Located on the left, it displays flight instruments.
    2. **Multi Function Display (MFD):** Located on the right, it shows GPS and other operational information.
2. **Line Replaceable Units (LRUs):**
    1. Modular components controlling various system functions.
    2. Responsible for flight displays, engine data, navigation, and communication.
3. **Integrated Avionics Units:**
    1. Two units acting as main communication hubs.
    2. Each contains a navigation receiver, communication radio, and GPS receiver.
4. **Air Data Computer (ADC):**
    1. Processes information from the pitot-static system and outside air temperature probe.
    2. Computes pressure altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, and outside air temperature (OAT).
5. **Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS):**
    1. Solid-state unit replacing traditional gyros.
    2. Computes aircraft attitude and heading using sensors, accelerometers, and rate sensors.
    3. Receives data from a magnetometer for accurate heading information.
6. **Engine Monitoring Unit:**
    1. Processes signals from engine and airframe sensors.
    2. Provides digital readouts of engine instrumentation.
7. **Optional Components:**
    1. Satellite weather receiver.
    2. ADS-B receiver providing FIS-B and TIS-B services.
    3. Stormscope.
    4. Traffic awareness system.

## Controls and Interface:

1. **Bezel Controls Overview:**
    1. Knobs, buttons, and softkeys identically positioned on both PFD and MFD.
2. **Navigation Controls:**
    2. **Navigation Volume/ID Knob:** Controls audio level and toggles Morse code identifier.
    3. **Navigation Frequency Transfer Button ("Flip-Flop" Button):** Switches active and standby navigation frequencies.
    4. **Navigation Tuning Knob:** Dual knob for setting navigation frequencies.
    5. **Heading Knob:** Sets desired heading on the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI).
3. **Autopilot Controls (GFC 700):**
    1. Twelve buttons arranged in two parallel rows (may be on MFD in some models).
    2. Combines autopilot and flight director functions.
4. **Altitude Selector Knob:**
    1. Located in the lower left corner.
    2. Dual knob sets altitude value above the altimeter.
5. **Softkeys:**
    1. Twelve keys along the bottom of the bezel.
    2. Functions vary depending on operating mode.
    3. The same key can have different names and functions (e.g., Engine, Off, Metric).
6. **Flight Management System (FMS) Knobs and Buttons:**
    1. Concentric knobs and six buttons above help navigate menus, flight plans, and procedures.
7. **Joystick (Range Button):**
    1. Used to position the pointer on the map page.
    2. Changes the map range.
8. **Course/Baro Knob:**
    1. Dual-function knob.
    2. Sets altimeter barometric pressure and adjusts course.
9. **Communication Controls:**
    1. Last three buttons/knobs function similarly to navigation controls.

## Operational Tips:

1. **Hand Usage Habit:**
    1. Use one hand to fly the airplane.
    2. Use the other hand to set up communication or navigation frequencies, adjust the audio panel, or use the autopilot.
2. **The "Tuning Box":**
    1. Central location of controls for ease of use.
    2. Audio panel is the center of the box.
    3. Communication controls are to the left of the audio panel.
    4. Navigation controls are to the right of the audio panel.
    5. GFC 700 autopilot controls are also to the right of the audio panel.

## Power-Up Sequence and Modes:

1. **Reversionary (Backup) Mode:**
    1. Activated when the system first powers up during preflight checks.
    2. PFD incorporates engine instruments and annunciators.
2. **Normal Mode:**
    1. After starting the engine and turning on the avionics switch.
    2. MFD displays a power-up information screen.
    3. Pilot reviews and acknowledges information by pressing the appropriate softkey.
    4. PFD displays flight instruments; MFD shows flight information, usually the map page.

The G1000 Glass Cockpit System is a highly integrated avionics suite that provides a wealth of digital flight information, enhancing situational awareness and operational efficiency for pilots.

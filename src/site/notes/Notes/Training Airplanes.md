# Training Airplanes
> [[Notes/Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes\|Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes]]

This section provides an overview of common airplanes used for flight training, highlighting their characteristics and differences to help new student pilots familiarize themselves with various training aircraft.

## Cessna High-Wing Models:
1. Cessna 172 "Skyhawk":
    1. Four-seat aircraft.
    2. Cruise speed around 120 knots.
    3. Over 44,000 produced since the 1950s; most popular training airplane ever built.
    4. Still in production today.
2. Cessna 152:
    1. Two-seat trainer.
    2. Cruise speed around 95 knots.
    3. Smaller and lighter than the 172.

## Diamond Aircraft:

1. Diamond DA20:
    1. Two-seat trainer.
    2. Made primarily of composite construction.
    3. Cruise speed between 120 and 130 knots.
2. Diamond DA40:
    1. Four-seat aircraft.
    2. Cruise speed between 130 and 150 knots, depending on the model.
    3. Composite construction similar to the DA20.

## Cirrus Aircraft:

1. Cirrus SR20 and SR22:
    1. Four-seat composite airplanes.
    2. Higher cruise speeds compared to other trainers.
    3. Equipped with an airframe parachute for emergencies.

## Piper PA-28 Series:

1. Includes models like Cherokee, Archer, Warrior, and Cadet.
    1. All share the same basic airframe.
    2. Cruise speeds between 115 and 130 knots.
    3. Popular choice for flight training.

## Nose Wheel Differences:

1. Steerable Nose Wheel (Cessna and Piper):
    1. Nose wheel is connected to the rudder pedals for steering on the ground.
2. Free-Castering Nose Wheel (Diamond and Cirrus):
    1. Nose wheel pivots freely.
    2. Requires differential braking to steer on the ground.

## Tailwheel Airplanes:

1. Characteristics:
    1. No nose wheel; main landing gear is forward, and a small tail wheel supports the rear.
    2. More rugged; suitable for rough surfaces away from paved runways.
    3. More challenging to control during takeoff and landing.
2. Training Considerations:
    1. Pilots often complete initial training in nosewheel airplanes.
    2. Additional training required to transition to tailwheel aircraft after obtaining a pilot certificate.

## Light Sport Airplanes (LSA):

1. Designed for Sport Pilot Certificate holders but also used for Private Pilot training.
2. Characteristics of LSA:
    1. No more than two seats.
    2. Limited to a maximum airspeed and takeoff weight.
3. Popular LSA Models:
    1. Flight Design CTLS.
    2. Tecnam P92.
    3. Vans RV12.

Understanding the variety of training airplanes and their unique features helps new student pilots make informed decisions about their flight training journey.

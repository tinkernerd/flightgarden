# Slow Flight
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]


This section provides an overview of slow flight, its principles, and the techniques required to perform it safely and effectively. Slow flight is essential for understanding the aircraft's behavior near stall speeds and improving control during critical phases like takeoff and landing.

## Introduction to Slow Flight:

1. The Airman Certification Standards (ACS) include slow flight in the same area as power-off and power-on stalls.
2. Purpose of learning slow flight:
    1. Familiarize with the feel and perceptions near stall speeds.
    2. Develop reflexes for prompt corrective action.
    3. Enhance control feel and understanding of airspeed and attitude relationships.
3. Relevance of slow flight:
    1. Improves technique during takeoff and landing phases.
    2. Prepares for maximum performance maneuvers.

## Mechanics of Slow Flight:

1. Maintaining altitude at low airspeeds:
    1. Requires increased angle of attack.
    2. Leads to a significant rise in induced drag.
2. Understanding drag:
    1. Induced drag increases as airspeed decreases.
    2. Parasite drag decreases with lower airspeed but doesn't offset total drag increase.
3. Total drag and thrust:
    1. Thrust must equal drag in straight and level unaccelerated flight.
    2. Airspeed corresponding to lowest total drag is for maximum endurance.
4. Region of reversed command (backside of the power curve):
    1. Requires increased thrust to maintain altitude at slower airspeeds.
    2. Opposite of typical vehicle behavior where more power equals more speed.

## Performing Slow Flight:

1. Preparation:
    1. Select an altitude at least 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL).
        1. 1,000 feet AGL if working towards a Sport Pilot certificate.
    2. Perform pre-maneuver checklist and clear the area.
2. Entering slow flight:
    1. Reduce power by approximately 500 RPM below level flight power.
    2. Apply back elevator pressure to maintain altitude as speed decreases.
    3. Trim the aircraft to relieve control pressures.
    4. Adjust power and pitch to stabilize at 5â€“10 knots above stall speed.
3. Maintaining slow flight:
    1. Use right rudder to counteract engine torque, P-factor, and spiraling slipstream.
    2. Divide attention between outside references and instruments.
    3. Monitor stall warning devices; avoid continuous activation.
    4. Scan for other aircraft; maintain situational awareness.
4. Understanding power and pitch relationship:
    1. Reducing power causes descent; nose must be lowered to maintain airspeed.
    2. Increasing power causes climb; slight nose-up pitch change maintains airspeed.
5. Turning during slow flight:
    1. Perform turns up to 30 degrees of bank while maintaining altitude.
    2. Add power during turns to compensate for loss of vertical lift.
    3. Adjust pitch to maintain airspeed during turns.
    4. Steeper banks require more power.
6. Maneuvering with flaps:
    1. Practice slow flight in all flap configurations.
    2. Effects of flaps:
        1. Allow wing to produce required lift at lower airspeeds.
        2. Change wing camber and chord, increasing angle of attack.
        3. Lower stalling speed.
    3. Adjustments when extending flaps:
        1. Flaps 10 degrees: slight increase in power and nose-down pitch.
        2. Flaps 20 degrees: further nose-down adjustment and more power.
        3. Flaps 30 degrees: additional nose-down pitch and power increase.
        4. Trim after each adjustment to relieve control pressures.
7. Recovery from slow flight:
    1. Apply full power.
    2. Retract flaps incrementally, one position at a time.
    3. Use back elevator pressure to compensate for loss of lift during flap retraction.
    4. Adjust trim between each flap position.
    5. Ensure airspeed is above no-flap stall speed before full retraction.

## Key Takeaways:

1. Slow flight enhances understanding of aircraft control near stall speeds.
2. Mastering slow flight is foundational for advanced maneuvers and emergency procedures.
3. Consistent practice leads to increased comfort and confidence in all flight phases.
4. Remember the importance of coordination between power, pitch, and aircraft configuration.

By practicing slow flight, you develop essential skills for safe and efficient flying, particularly during critical phases like takeoff and landing. Continue to refine these techniques to build a solid foundation for your pilot training journey.

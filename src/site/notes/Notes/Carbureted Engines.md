# Carbureted Engines
> [[Private Pilot License (PPL) Notes \|All Class Notes]]

This section covers the operational differences of carbureted engines in training aircraft, including starting procedures, susceptibility to carburetor icing, and the use of carburetor heat to ensure safe engine operation.

## Fuel Primers and Choke Systems

- Many carbureted engines have a fuel primer used during engine start:
    - The primer injects fuel directly into the engine cylinders.
    - Makes starting easier in cold weather.
    - After using the primer, ensure it is closed and locked before takeoff.
- In carbureted "light sport" airplanes:
    - A 'choke' control is used for cold starting instead of a primer.
    - The choke activates an enriching circuit called a 'starting carburetor' that puts extra fuel into the engine.
    - The throttle must be closed for the choke to work effectively.

## Starting Procedures

- Carbureted engines are started with the mixture control in the full-rich position.
- In contrast, fuel-injected engines are started with the mixture control in the idle cutoff position.

## Carburetor Icing

- Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing:
    - The venturi effect in the carburetor causes a rapid pressure decrease.
    - Fuel vaporization reduces air temperature by up to 70°F.
    - This cooling can cause water vapor to form frost or ice inside the carburetor, even on hot days.
    - Ice formation reduces air and fuel flow, causing lower power and potential engine stoppage.
- Conditions favorable for carburetor icing:
    - High humidity or visible moisture.
    - Temperatures below 70°F (21°C).
    - Especially at low power settings.
- Signs of carburetor icing:
    - On engines with fixed pitch propellers, a gradual reduction of RPM at a constant throttle setting.

## Use of Carburetor Heat

- The solution to carburetor ice is the use of carburetor heat:
    - Applying carburetor heat increases the engine intake air temperature by diverting air over the exhaust manifold.
    - The heated air melts existing ice and prevents further ice formation.
- If carburetor ice is suspected:
    - Always apply full carburetor heat immediately.
    - The engine may run rough with a further drop in RPM as the ice melts and water enters the cylinders.
    - After the ice has melted and water is exhausted, RPM will increase.
- Effects of using carburetor heat when no ice is present:
    - A slight drop in engine RPM and power.
    - Heated intake air is less dense, reducing the quantity of air available for combustion.
- Routine use of carburetor heat:
    - Check carburetor heat during engine run-up before takeoff; expect a small drop in RPM when applied.
    - Use carburetor heat when operating at lower RPMs, such as during descent, approach, and landing.
    - This is a preventative measure to ensure carburetor ice does not form at reduced throttle settings.

Understanding the operation of carbureted engines, including proper starting procedures and the management of carburetor icing, is essential for safe and efficient flight.
